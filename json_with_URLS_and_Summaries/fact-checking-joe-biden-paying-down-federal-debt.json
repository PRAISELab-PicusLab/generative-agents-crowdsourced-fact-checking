        "title": "Biden Leaves Misleading Impression on U.S. Debt - FactCheck.org",
        "summary": "President Joe Biden criticized former President Donald Trump for increasing the national debt by nearly $8 trillion during Trump's four-year term, attributing it to Trump’s “unpaid tax cuts and other spending”. However, this figure also includes bipartisan-approved coronavirus relief packages. Biden’s future plan, the $3.5 trillion “Build Back Better” budget, claims to be fully financed through increased taxes on large corporations and the wealthy, aiming to reduce the national debt in the long term, although that is uncertain. Trump’s tax cuts, chiefly benefiting the wealthy, significantly contributed to the debt, with the 2017 tax law projected to add $1.9 trillion to yearly deficits over ten years. Additionally, Trump’s term included bipartisan-supported budget acts that increased discretionary spending without being offset. Bipartisan COVID-19 relief spending further deepened the debt, with over $3 trillion approved to support the economy amid the pandemic. Such financial impacts underscore the role of both administrations and the bipartisan nature of some additions to the national debt.",

        "summary": "President Joe Biden, in a speech on inflation and the economy, attributed higher inflation to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming it's not due to spending. This assertion is debated among economists, with some suggesting pandemic relief spending contributed to inflation. Biden highlighted Sen. Rick Scott's plan to claim the Republicans would raise taxes, though Scott has distanced himself from advocating increases for working Americans and retirees. Biden's statement about oil production in his first year exceeding Trump's is accurate, but misleading as it was lower than in 2019 and 2020. He credited himself for deficit reduction, mostly a result of expiring pandemic spending. Biden said his Treasury would pay down the national debt; however, the public debt has increased by 10.2% under his administration. Regarding the 2017 Republican tax cuts, Biden's claim they weren't paid for is partially correct, as they raised some taxes to offset costs, reducing the net law cost.",

        "summary": "President Joe Biden claimed that his administration is set to pay down a portion of the federal debt, which he stated never happened under his predecessor, Donald Trump. The Treasury Department announced plans to pay down $26 billion in debt during the second quarter of 2022. However, this modest reduction will be overshadowed by borrowing $668 billion in the first quarter and an expected $182 billion in the third quarter. Biden’s statement overlooked that the Trump administration had also planned a debt paydown in the second quarter of 2020, which was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, second-quarter cash influx from tax payments typically aids debt paydowns, but these are not consistent across all quarters. Biden's claim is rated as Half True.",

        "summary": "During President Biden's first year in office, the U.S. national debt increased by $2.11 trillion, reaching $29.87 trillion. The Federal Reserve emerged as the largest creditor, holding 19.1% of the debt, an increase from 16.5% the previous year, followed by Social Security, which owns 9.2% of the debt. The American Rescue Plan Act significantly contributed to the debt, accounting for about $1.34 trillion, or 63.5% of the debt increase.

        "summary": "President Biden highlighted the reduction of the national deficit and announced that the U.S. will pay down the national debt this quarter for the first time in six years. Biden attributed this to strong job growth that increased tax revenues. The Treasury Department estimated a $1.5 trillion decline in this fiscal year's budget deficit, better than initially forecasted, aiming to reduce the annual deficit below $1.3 trillion. Biden contrasted this with previous rising deficits under former President Donald Trump's administration. Despite the economic improvements, it remains unclear if the deficit reduction will benefit Biden politically. Voters often prioritize issues like healthcare, income, and inflation over deficit cuts during elections. Biden faces challenges in convincing voters of the benefits of fiscal responsibility, as low interest rates have previously softened the impact of high deficits. The Biden administration continues to focus on stabilizing government finances, with deficit reduction also a notable priority for influential Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.",

This quarter's debt management assumes an end-of-June cash balance of $800 billion. The Treasury has been reducing debt auction sizes since November after significantly increasing debt issuance in 2020 to fund pandemic-related expenditures. For the July to September quarter, the Treasury expects to borrow $182 billion in privately held net marketable debt, targeting an end-of-September cash balance of $650 billion. In the first quarter, $668 billion in net debt was issued, ending with a cash balance of $652 billion.",

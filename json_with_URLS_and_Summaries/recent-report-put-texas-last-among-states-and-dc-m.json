        "summary": "Beto O'Rourke emphasizes the need for affordable healthcare access for all Texans, noting that Texas has a high uninsured rate and ranks last in mental health care access. He criticizes Governor Greg Abbott for refusing to expand Medicaid, which would bring $100 billion of federal tax dollars to Texas to insure more people. This inaction contributes to high property taxes and healthcare costs, as uninsured Texans' emergency room visits drive up insurance premiums. O'Rourke proposes expanding Medicaid to create jobs, sustain rural hospitals, and reduce costs. Additionally, he plans to address the nursing shortage by covering education for 7,500 new nurses annually and restoring funding to attract doctors and mental health providers to Texas.",
        "snippet": "All Texans deserve access to affordable health care so that theyre well enough to go to school, pursue a career, and live to their full potential. But with 1 in 5 Texans uninsured, Texas leads the nation in the number of people who cant afford to see a doctor or fill a prescriptionand we rank dead last in the nation when it comes to mental health care access."

        "summary": "The claim that Texas ranks last in the nation for access to mental health care is based on a 2022 report from Mental Health America, which ranked Texas No. 50 overall, behind Alabama, and No. 51 when including Washington, D.C. This ranking includes factors like access to insurance, treatment availability, mental health workforce, and the cost of care. Texas had poor rankings in several categories, including high uninsured rates and lack of treatment for youth and adults. However, it performed better in some areas, such as the percentage of adults reporting an unmet need for mental health care. Additionally, data from other sources, such as the Household Pulse Survey and Kaiser Family Foundation, show that Texas ranks higher in certain aspects, such as unmet need for counseling. Mental Health America's data, though, is based on 2019 figures and may not reflect changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "summary": "A report by The Commonwealth Fund ranks Texas last in the United States for health care access and affordability. This poor ranking is attributed mainly to Texas's decision not to expand Medicaid eligibility, which has resulted in a high uninsured rate, especially among minorities. Approximately 20% of African American adults and over a third of Hispanic adults in Texas were uninsured in 2017. Texas also ranks low in various health care indicators, placing 49th overall among states and the District of Columbia. Despite these challenges, Texas has improved in areas such as reducing unnecessary anti-psychotic medication in nursing homes and improving diabetes treatment and patient mobility. Expanding Medicaid is suggested as a way for Texas to improve its ranking significantly.",

While Texas ranks 51st in the Access to Care category (the lowest in the nation), it is not specifically ranked 50th. Therefore, the statement is somewhat true, but not entirely precise. Texas holds the worst position for mental health access overall, but it ranks 44th in the overall mental health ranking.",

Dr. Sarah Wakefield from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center discussed this issue, citing Texas's large size and many rural areas as challenges for adequately distributing mental health professionals. Programs like the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium and its initiatives such as the Child Psychiatry Access Network (CPAN) and Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine (TCHATT) aim to improve access by supporting clinicians and providing school-based mental health assessments. Dr. Wakefield emphasized the importance of recognizing signs of mental distress, such as isolation and changes in daily functioning, and ensuring access to mental health professionals. While acknowledging the complexity of violence and the importance of mental health programs in preventing crises, she implied that mental health care alone is not a replacement for measures like gun control.",

        "summary": "Senator Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, introduced legislation to transfer unused federal border wall materials to states like Texas and Arizona, allowing them to use the materials for wall construction. The federal government has been paying millions to guard stockpiled materials that were halted after President Biden's first day in office. Ernst criticized the waste, citing $3 million per day spent on guarding the materials. Her proposal would allow states to access the stockpile, helping them save money while addressing border security. Texas has already received some materials, covering 1.3 miles of the border.",

        "summary": "Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst introduced the BUILD IT Act, a bill aimed at allowing border states to utilize unused materials initially meant for constructing a border wall. The proposal enables states like Arizona and Texas to build their own barriers along the southern border. Ernst criticized President Biden for halting border wall projects and stated that taxpayers are incurring costs protecting unused materials. Fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley supported the bill, emphasizing the financial and security implications of Biden's decision. The Federation for American Immigration Reform and several Republican senators co-sponsor the bill. In response to halted construction, Texas acquired 1,700 unused wall panels to aid in border security efforts, with Governor Greg Abbott asserting that Texas is compensating for federal inaction.",

        "summary": "A report by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee estimates that the Biden administration's halt to border wall construction has resulted in a waste of between $1.837 billion and $2.087 billion in taxpayer dollars. Since Biden took office, the government has been spending at least $3 million per day to guard unused border wall materials, a situation stemming from the suspension of seven border wall-related projects. Between January 20 and July 15, the Department of Defense (DOD) has paid contractors between $618 and $708 million for this activity, with the total cost expected to rise to between $798 million and $1.048 billion by year-end. Additionally, the DOD's suspension of related funding accounts could result in up to $1.039 billion in costs for contract terminations and other expenses. The broader impact of this policy includes other taxpayer costs, such as housing and services for illegal immigrants, though these costs were not covered in the GOP report.",

Lankford notes that at the end of the Trump administration, approximately $10 billion had been transferred to two Department of Defense accounts for border wall ..."

        "summary": "The Biden Administration is spending $3 million per day to prevent the completion of the southern border wall, according to Republican Senator Joni Ernst. This figure comes from a Senate Minority Staff Report, which estimates that the administration has wasted over $2 billion in suspension and termination costs since halting the wall’s construction in January 2021. The costs include guarding unused materials like steel and concrete. The Department of Defense initially spent $6 million daily, but this decreased after staff layoffs. Ernst proposed the BUILD IT Act, suggesting that unused materials be transferred to states willing to finish the wall’s construction.",

        "summary": "More than $100 million worth of taxpayer-funded border wall materials in Texas are reportedly going to waste, rusting away since President Biden halted construction upon taking office. Despite having paid for these materials, including around 10,000 steel panels enough for 100 miles of wall, construction was stopped. Former Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott reported that the administration is incurring daily costs of around $5 million for contracts that were paused. Only 14 miles of wall were completed before the halt, while former President Trump had constructed about 453 miles. The halt and rollback of Trump's policies have contributed to a surge in migrants at the US border, leading to frustrations among Border Patrol agents who state that the wall is needed.",

She cites a 2021 Republican report estimating a $3 million daily cost for guarding materials such as steel and concrete, although this figure has not been independently verified. Some of these materials, valued at approximately $265 million, have been repurposed, including for border repairs and donations to Texas. The Defense Department reported that it continued to incur costs due to contracts for the suspended construction. The estimate of daily costs remains unconfirmed, and federal spending due to contract cancellations could reach over $1 billion. As the claims’ expenses are not independently verified and cost estimates for border work are reportedly unclear or delayed, the claim was rated as 'Half True' by PolitiFact.",

        "summary": "Senator Joni Ernst claimed that the U.S. is spending $3 million per day to guard unused border wall materials. This statement was based on a July 2021 report highlighting costs incurred due to the suspension of construction on the border wall project initiated by President Biden. Initially, these costs ranged from $3-4 million per day, covering contract-related expenses including workforce, equipment, and materials management. However, the Department of Defense confirmed that these costs have significantly decreased over time. As of now, $88,000 per day is being spent primarily to secure construction sites, a figure that has dropped since the initial report and represents less than 3% of Ernst’s claim. Furthermore, the transfer of surplus border wall materials to states like Texas is already occurring, with unused materials being repurposed for state-level projects. Ernst's use of outdated figures without seeking updated information from available government sources was criticized by the Fact Checker, resulting in her claim being rated as inaccurate.",

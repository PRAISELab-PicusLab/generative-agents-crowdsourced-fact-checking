        "summary": "After the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, lawmakers supporting abortion rights argued that some justices who voted in the majority had misled senators during their confirmation hearings. Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett were specifically scrutinized for their past statements about Roe v. Wade. Barrett referred to Roe as not a 'super precedent,' Kavanaugh emphasized Roe as an important precedent reaffirmed by the Casey decision, and Gorsuch called it 'a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court.' Despite their statements, these justices ultimately voted to overturn Roe. Other justices, including Alito, Thomas, and Roberts, made various comments about precedent, but none committed to keeping Roe intact",

        "summary": "During their Senate confirmation hearings, Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all acknowledged that Roe v. Wade was established precedent but were careful not to commit to whether they would uphold or overturn it. Gorsuch called Roe a precedent that had been reaffirmed multiple times but refused to label it 'super precedent' or express a personal view on its correctness. Kavanaugh also referred to Roe as 'settled as precedent' and emphasized its reaffirmation in subsequent cases like Planned Parenthood v. Casey. However, he remained open to revisiting cases based on legal arguments. Barrett, while agreeing with Justice Scalia’s judicial philosophy of originalism, declined to state if she thought Roe was wrongly decided, asserting that she had no agenda to overturn Roe and would follow the law of stare decisis in any case. All three justices avoided giving definitive answers about whether they would overrule Roe, instead stressing their commitment to judicial impartiality and the importance of precedent. The statement 'Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett assured the Senate Judiciary Committee and the American people that Roe v. Wade was established precedent' is true based on the summary. During their confirmation hearings, each of the justices acknowledged that Roe v. Wade was established precedent. However, they did not explicitly commit to upholding it or not considering overturning it in future cases.",
        "snippet": "Kavanaugh: Well, as a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade. So Roe v. So Roe v. Wade held, of course, and it reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v."

        "summary": "Rep. Don Beyer stated that Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett assured the Senate Judiciary Committee and the American people that Roe v. Wade was 'established precedent.' While the three justices did affirm Roe as a precedent during their confirmation hearings, they qualified their remarks. Barrett did not view Roe as a 'super precedent,' and Gorsuch avoided directly addressing whether it was. Kavanaugh expressed openness to hearing arguments against established precedents. Therefore, Beyer's statement is mostly true, as the justices acknowledged Roe's precedent status but did not consider it untouchable",
        "snippet": "Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett assured the Senate Judiciary Committee and the American people that Roe v. Wade was established precedent. Wade was established precedent. Beyers statement about the judges - all of whom support a draft Supreme Court ruling that would overturn Roe - is correct, but comes with a caveat."

        "summary": "The claim that Supreme Court Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh said they wouldn’t overturn Roe v. Wade during their confirmation hearings is false. While all three justices stated that Roe v. Wade was an important precedent, none explicitly promised not to overturn it. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022, in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which also affected the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey.",

        "summary": "The article discusses how Supreme Court Justices, including Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett, assured the Senate and the public during their confirmation hearings that Roe v. Wade was settled precedent, yet they later voted to overturn it in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision. The justices had previously stated that Roe v. Wade and related decisions like Planned Parenthood v. Casey were important precedents that should be respected. However, the court's 5-1-3 ruling in Dobbs revealed that the justices' assurances were misleading. The article critiques the judicial nomination process, emphasizing how it disregards nominees' public affirmations of precedent, focusing instead on who controls the court. The text also reflects on how the changing makeup of the court, influenced by political maneuvers such as Mitch McConnell's refusal to hold hearings for Merrick Garland, led to the appointment of conservative justices who ultimately overturned abortion rights.",
        "snippet": "Kavanaugh joined Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett in overturning both the Roe and Casey decisions. The courts 5-1-3 opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization harshly illustrates the incredible phoniness of the judicial nomination process."

        "title": "FACT CHECK: Democrat Cindy Axne Claims Republican ... - Breitbart",
        "summary": "Democrat Cindy Axne's campaign ad claimed that her Republican challenger Zach Nunn prioritized his donors over children's safety by accepting contributions from an amusement park CEO before sponsoring legislation to relax park safety rules, which allegedly led to an 11-year-old's death. This claim was deemed misleading, as the ad omitted that the bipartisan legislation, supported by both Republican and Democrat leaders, did not affect the ride involved in the accident. The legislation addressed staffing shortages by lowering the minimum operator age from 18 to 16 and did not relate to the safety violations cited in the accident report. Nunn's campaign criticized the ad as deceitful, accusing Axne of exploiting a tragedy for political gain. Other Republican figures condemned the ad, emphasizing Axne's record on various issues.",
        "snippet": "The Raging River ride had 17 safety violations at the time of the July accident, a tragedy that could have been avoided. But Zach Nunn took money from Adventure Land CEO then sponsored legislation to loosen amusement park safety rules. A child died. Zach Nunn put his big donors ahead of the safety of Iowa families."

        "title": "Fact Check: Is Axne attack against Zach Nunn factual? - KCCI",
        "summary": "The attack ad by Cindy Axne accuses Zach Nunn of taking over $50,000 in donations from Adventureland’s former CEO and sponsoring a bill to loosen amusement park safety rules, implying this led to a child’s death. However, the analyzed facts show: The bipartisan bill allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to operate carnival rides to address post-COVID staffing shortages. An amendment requiring an 18-year-old supervisor failed, but the bill passed. Nunn did receive significant campaign contributions from the Krantz family, Adventureland's former owners. On the day of the fatal Raging River ride accident, all ride operators were over 18 and experienced. The bill had no connection to the incident. The claim links Nunn’s actions to the tragedy, but no evidence supports that the bill caused or contributed to the accident.",

        "title": "Fact Check | Blaming one legislator for accident ignores a lot",
        "summary": "A campaign ad released by U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne exaggerated the actions of her opponent, state Sen. Zach Nunn, by linking him to a fatal amusement park accident in Iowa. The ad claims the accident could have been avoided if not for Nunn's legislation that allegedly loosened safety rules for amusement parks, asserting he prioritized donations over safety. The legislation, House File 558, lowered the minimum age for ride operators from 18 to 16, but the operators during the incident were over 18, making the ad's implication false. The legislation had bipartisan support, including from Democratic leaders, and aimed to address post-COVID workforce issues. Nunn had received donations from the family that owned the park, but the death was unrelated to the legislation. The ad is rated as mostly false for these inaccuracies.",
        "snippet": "But Zach Nunn took money from Adventurelands CEO, then sponsored legislation to loosen amusement park safety rules. A child died. Zach Nunn put his big donor first, ahead of the safety of Iowa families. Nunn sponsored a bill in the Iowa Senate that was the counterpart of one that became law in 2021."

        "summary": "Cindy Axne’s campaign ad accuses Republican Zach Nunn of prioritizing donations from the Adventureland CEO over public safety, linking him to a 2021 amusement park tragedy where an 11-year-old boy died. The ad highlights Nunn’s acceptance of over $50,000 from the Krantz family, former Adventureland owners, and his support for legislation allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to operate carnival rides. While the bill received bipartisan support and was aimed at addressing staffing shortages post-COVID-19, it was unrelated to the accident. Everyone on duty at the ride during the tragedy was over 18. Critics, including Nunn’s campaign and Iowa Republican Chair Jeff Kaufmann, call the ad misleading and politically desperate.",

        "summary": "Rep. Cindy Axne defended her campaign ads attacking Sen. Zach Nunn over his ties to Adventureland amusement park, following the death of an 11-year-old boy there. The ads criticized Nunn for accepting campaign donations from Adventureland owners and supporting legislation that lowered the minimum age for amusement park ride operators from 18 to 16. Axne argued the ads highlighted Nunn's prioritization of interests over Iowans. However, some pointed out the legislation was unrelated to the death, as the operator during the incident was over 18. Politifact rated the ad “mostly false.” Despite changes to the district making it lean Republican, Axne remains confident about her re-election.",
        "snippet": "The ads criticize Nunn for taking campaign donations from the owners and executives of Adventureland, as well as for support of legislation which lowered the minimum age for amusement park ride operators from 18 to 16 because of workforce shortages. A tragedy that could have been avoided, the Axne campaign ad said."

        "title": "Democrats embrace law enforcement to hit GOP on crime - Axios",
        "summary": "Democrats, in states like Ohio, Georgia, and Florida, are emphasizing their support for law enforcement to counter Republican criticisms of their crime policies. This strategy comes after the 'defund the police' debate, which harmed the Democratic Party's image on crime. Key figures, including Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Tim Ryan in Ohio, have used law enforcement endorsements to criticize their Republican opponents. In Ohio, Ryan criticized J.D. Vance for proposing to eliminate the ATF, while in Florida, Val Demings has highlighted her law enforcement experience to rebut accusations of supporting defunding. Democrats, generally adopting a more moderate crime stance under President Biden, aim to balance police reform with respect for law enforcement's role in public safety.",
        "snippet": "The most recent ad, released last week, is narrated by a former deputy sheriff who said Kemp 'makes us less safe' with his 'dangerous' concealed carry law. In Ohio, the Democratic nominee for Senate, Rep. Tim Ryan, enlisted the help of a sheriff for an ad last month accusing his Republican opponent J.D. Vance of attacking law enforcement."

        "summary": "A senior aide to President Joe Biden claimed that congressional Republicans 'defunded the police' by voting against the American Rescue Plan Act. This claim was misleading, as Republicans' opposition to the legislation wasn't a vote to cut or eliminate federal funding for law enforcement. The American Rescue Plan provided economic relief for individuals and governments affected by the pandemic, including potential funding for law enforcement, but did not mandate that it be used for that purpose. Republican objections focused more on the overall bill's size, its allocation, and preference for rescinding unspent funds rather than explicitly targeting police funding. Additionally, while former President Trump proposed cutting the Community Oriented Policing Services program, Congress increased funding during his tenure. The Biden administration argues that Republicans opposed the rescue plan despite its support for hiring police officers. However, opposing the plan isn't equivalent to actively reducing police budgets, as suggested by Richmond's remarks.",

        "summary": "In the video, the accusation against Vance is that he called law enforcement corrupt and proposed eliminating an agency that combats violent drug trafficking. This aligns with the claim that Vance's position could be interpreted as a desire to reduce or defund certain aspects of law enforcement, specifically the ATF. Therefore, the ad portrays him as someone who could undermine law enforcement efforts, supporting the idea that he wants to defund law enforcement in that specific context. 'J.D. Vance wants to defund law enforcement' can be considered true",

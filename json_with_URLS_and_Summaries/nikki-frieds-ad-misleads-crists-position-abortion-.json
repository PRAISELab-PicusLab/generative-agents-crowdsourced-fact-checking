        "title": "Charlie Crist and Nikki Fried blast each other on the airwaves",
        "summary": "Charlie Crist and Nikki Fried, candidates in Florida's Democratic primary for governor, are intensifying their campaign attacks as the August 23 primary approaches. Fried criticizes Crist by highlighting his past support for mandatory minimums during the 'war on drugs' and labeling him 'pro-life' while she considers herself 'pro-choice.' Although Crist previously identified as pro-life, he now supports women's right to choose. Crist counters by accusing Fried of supporting Florida Republicans and criticizing her for calling for Hillary Clinton's arrest and associating with accused sex trafficker Rep. Matt Gaetz. Fried has spent approximately $950,000 on advertisements, while Crist's campaign and the PAC supporting him have collectively spent around $2.8 million.",
        "snippet": "Crist has used the pro-life label before, but clarified recently that he supports a woman's choice to receive an abortion. Crist, a former governor of Florida, has hit back at Fried with the same..."

        "summary": "Charlie Crist, a Democratic candidate in the Florida gubernatorial primary, has reaffirmed his strong pro-choice stance in response to criticism from Nikki Fried, a fellow candidate. Fried accused Crist of being 'pro-life' and called his changing abortion position 'disingenuous.' Crist defended his position by highlighting his consistent pro-choice record, including endorsements from Planned Parenthood and NARAL, and his historical opposition to anti-abortion measures. He cited his vote against a 24-hour waiting period for abortions in 1995 and his veto of anti-abortion legislation as governor of Florida. Crist supports Roe vs. Wade, permitting first and second trimester abortions and allowing third-trimester restrictions unless the mother’s or child’s life is at risk. Crist is regarded as a frontrunner in the Democratic primary race.",
        "snippet": "Washington D.C.  Florida's Democratic gubernatorial primary is being intensified with many contenders anxious to dethrone Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) . Progressive candidate Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried (D-FL) has bashed perceived frontrunner and career politician, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-FL), going as far as to call him 'pro-life' "

        "title": "Charlie Crist: Im Pro-Life Except When It Comes to Abortion",
        "summary": "Charlie Crist has shifted his stance on being 'pro-life' throughout his political career. While he described himself as 'pro-life' during his time as a Republican, he clarified during a Democratic party event that he is 'hands-off' regarding women's rights. His earlier campaigns revealed conflicting positions, from supporting a woman’s right to choose with careful consideration to opposing changes in abortion laws while emphasizing changing hearts, not laws. As a Republican Senate candidate in 2010, Crist supported pro-life legislative efforts but later reversed his position by vetoing an anti-abortion bill. His evolving views make his current stance unclear as he transitions to running as a Democrat",
        "snippet": "In response to a question from someone who recalled his days as a pro-life Republican, Crist said, Im pro-life, but when it comes to a womans rights, Im hands-off."

        "title": "'Pro-Life' Charlie Crist vs 'Pro-Choice' Charlie Crist - The Floridian",
        "summary": "The Democratic gubernatorial primary in Florida is shaping up as a contest primarily between Nikki Fried and Charlie Crist. Both candidates are aiming to secure support from the Progressive base to challenge Governor Ron DeSantis. Nikki Fried is known for her pro-choice stance, emphasizing her commitment to veto any anti-choice legislation. Charlie Crist, once a pro-life Republican, now supports reproductive freedom, aligning himself with the pro-choice movement. Despite both candidates' efforts, polls show them trailing behind DeSantis, but Crist is currently leading Fried in a head-to-head matchup. The primary will likely highlight issues such as abortion, which Fried's team is expected to prioritize in the campaign.",
        "snippet": "Last year, Crist stated that 77% of Americans support reproductive freedom  and Im proud to be one of them.' Crist reiterated that he supports women's right to choose, but that wasn't the case just 11 years ago when the Republican governor-turned Independent ran of office as a 'Pro-Life' candidate."

Crist, a former governor, positions himself as the candidate to defeat Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, promoting unity and civility in contrast to DeSantis' rhetoric. Crist has faced criticism from primary opponent Nikki Fried over his past positions, particularly on abortion. Despite referring to himself as 'pro-life' Crist asserts he has always been pro-choice in decisions impacting women's rights, citing his record of opposing anti-abortion bills and his 100% rating from Planned Parenthood. Crist's platform includes boosting teacher pay, repealing certain educational laws, reducing housing costs, and legalizing recreational marijuana. Acknowledging the challenge of a GOP-controlled legislature, Crist frames the election as a battle between right and wrong. He plans a media campaign for the general election should he win the primary.",

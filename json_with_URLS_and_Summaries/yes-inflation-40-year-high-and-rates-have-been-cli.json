        "summary": "The claim by U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher that 'inflation has gone up every month of the Biden presidency and just hit another 40-year high' is mostly true. Inflation has risen steadily under President Biden, reaching its highest rate in 40 years, with the Consumer Price Index showing an increase from 1.7% in February 2021 to 8.5% in March 2022. However, there was a slight plateau in inflation between June and September 2021. While inflation started increasing before Biden took office, the overall trend has continued during his presidency, making Gallagher's statement largely accurate, but with some context needed regarding the mid-2021 plateau.",

The next inflation update is scheduled for release on Sept. 13 at 8:30 a.m. ET. It will offer the latest data on inflation trends, with expectations that the rate may continue to fluctuate. In August 2022, inflation remained high at 8.3%, slightly down from July's 8.5%. The inflation rate had seen a gradual decline after its peak in June, but still remained significantly elevated compared to previous years. Monthly inflation in 2022 was marked by increases in June (1.2%) and March (1.0%), and slower rises in other months, such as October (0.5%). By December 2022, the inflation rate had decreased to 6.5%, but it was still notably high compared to historical averages. The ongoing inflationary pressures, driven by factors such as rising energy prices and supply chain issues, remain central to the economic discussions leading into the fall of 2022.",

        "summary": "'U.S. Inflation Rate by Year' provides a historical overview of inflation trends in the United States, highlighting the role of the business cycle and Federal Reserve policies. Inflation is measured by the percentage change in product and service prices year over year. The business cycle includes four phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough, each impacting inflation. The Federal Reserve aims for a 2% inflation rate, adjusting monetary policy to manage inflation and deflation. Notable events such as wars, economic crises, and policy changes have influenced inflation rates throughout history. The highest recorded inflation was 17.8% in 1917, and the U.S. faced significant inflation in the 1970s. Inflation matters because it reflects the economy's health, affecting both consumers and businesses.For the claim that inflation has consistently increased every month of Biden's presidency, the data shows that inflation was 1.4% in 2020 (Biden took office in January 2021) and rose significantly in 2021, reaching 7.0%. Inflation remained elevated in 2022 (6.5%) and 2023 (3.4%). However, the data does not explicitly confirm whether inflation increased every single month.",
        "snippet": "The first phase is the expansion phase. This is when economic growth is positive, with a healthy 2% rate of inflation. The Federal Reserve ('the Fed') considers this an acceptable rate of inflation. 1 On August 27, 2020, the Fed announced that it would allow a target inflation rate of more than 2% if that will help ensure maximum employment."

While inflation has increased significantly, particularly reaching 8.5% in March 2022, it did not rise every month. From June to September 2021, inflation remained relatively stable, and it slightly slowed in April 2022. Factors such as the Ukraine conflict, global supply chain issues, and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to inflation, with Biden initially calling it 'temporary'. Despite some moderation in inflation, economic challenges persist, influencing Biden's approval ratings ahead of the midterm elections.",

This marks the worst inflation year since 1981. Real wages have decreased in 8 out of 11 months under Biden, with a 2.4% drop in average hourly earnings from December 2020 to December 2021. Key goods and services have seen significant price hikes, including gasoline (up 49.6%), used cars (up 37.3%), and food items like beef and bacon (up 18.6%). The economic situation worsened alongside the worst jobs report of Biden's presidency, adding only 199,000 jobs in December, with labor force participation rates decreasing for several demographics. Critics argue that government spending, particularly Biden's proposed socialist reconciliation package, exacerbates the crisis.",

        "title": "Fact-check: How much of student debt is graduate school debt?",
        "summary": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis claimed that nearly 60% of student debt comes from graduate school loans. However, this statement is rated as Mostly False. The Congressional Budget Office found that about 60% of student debt is from undergraduate loans, not graduate. Although graduate students tend to borrow more on average, more people pursue undergraduate degrees. DeSantis' statement misrepresents the proportion of debt originating from graduate programs by implying a larger share than shown by data. The confusion likely stems from misinterpretations of data concerning debt held by households with graduate degrees, not exclusively incurred from graduate education.",

        "summary": "While only 25% of those with student loans attended graduate school, these individuals owe around 50% of all student debt, a significant portion of the $1.7 trillion U.S. student debt total. Graduate students often accumulate substantial debt due to generally higher tuition fees and no borrowing caps on federal student loans, unlike undergraduates who have a $31,000 limit. An increased number of enrollments in graduate programs has contributed to a rise in debt, driven partly by hopes of improving earnings and closing wage gaps. Income expectations and employment benefits linked to advanced degrees—such as higher weekly wages and lower unemployment rates—foster this trend despite high federal loan interest rates. Additionally, graduate students often carry residual undergraduate debt, which adds to their financial burden. The disparity in borrowing limits between undergraduate and graduate studies, coupled with prolonged educational timeframes and slower loan repayment initiation, exacerbates the debt levels for graduate students.",

        "title": "DeSantis Calls Push for Student Loan Forgiveness 'Wrong' - Newsmax",
        "summary": " 'The student debt that's out there, almost 60% of it is graduate school debt', stated Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as he criticized President Biden's potential student loan forgiveness. DeSantis argued that loan forgiveness unfairly burdens blue-collar workers, such as truck drivers or waitresses, with paying off debts incurred by individuals pursuing advanced degrees like Ph.D.s, law, or medical studies. He described this policy as 'wrong.' The remarks align with broader Republican opposition to loan forgiveness, which they argue is inequitable. DeSantis' comments follow Biden's indication that he is considering further loan forgiveness but ruled out $50,000 reductions. The pause on federal loan payments is currently extended through August, and Biden is expected to make a decision before its expiration. Student debt in the U.S. totals over $1.6 trillion, with 43 million borrowers, including 7 million in default. Democrats are pressuring Biden for action, seeing potential electoral benefits among young and educated voters ahead of the midterm elections. Meanwhile, Republicans, including Senator John Thune, have introduced legislation to limit the executive branch's ability to cancel or pause student loan payments, emphasizing a return to repayment as the pandemic recedes.",
        "snippet": "DeSantis slammed loan forgiveness on Friday as a backwards concept that punishes working class people by forcing them to absorb debt that isn't theirs for advanced degrees, Florida Politics reports. 'This student debt that's out there, almost 60% of it is graduate school debt' the Sunshine State governor said."

        "summary": "Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida expressed opposition to President Joe Biden's proposal to forgive student debt. DeSantis stated that nearly 60% of the debt targeted for forgiveness consists of graduate school debt, although he did not provide a source for this statistic. He argued that this forgiveness would largely benefit aspiring doctors and lawyers, suggesting they are not in need of debt relief. DeSantis rhetorically questioned why professions such as truck drivers, waitresses, and construction workers should be responsible for paying off debts for those pursuing advanced degrees, including programs like Ph.D.s in gender studies. President Biden, while campaigning, supported forgiving up to $10,000 per individual of federal student loans and is expected to decide on student loan forgiveness soon.",

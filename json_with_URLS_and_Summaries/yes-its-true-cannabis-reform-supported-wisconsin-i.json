        "title": "OH Senate Declines Cannabis Legalization Measure | NuggMD",
        "summary": "The Ohio Senate rejected a cannabis legalization measure in February 2022, despite 133,000 citizen signatures supporting it. Senate President Matt Huffman expressed doubts about Governor Mike DeWine signing the bill into law and cited legislative opposition, making it unlikely the measure would pass. However, the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, which led the push, plans to gather more signatures to get the measure on the November ballot. If approved, the measure would allow adults to possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis, cultivate up to six plants, and impose a 10% sales tax, with revenue going toward dispensaries and substance abuse programs. While full legalization remains uncertain, medical cannabis is available in Ohio.",
        "snippet": "It is up to the citizens to be the driving force in Ohio marijuana legalization efforts. The potential for legislators to consider the measure was just a pit stop on the way to legalization. The group leading the measure, Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, can still obtain the needed signatures to get onto the November 2022 ballot."

        "summary": "The statement made by State Senator Melissa Agard, that cannabis reform is supported by the majority of Wisconsin residents, including a majority of Republicans, is accurate/true. A Marquette Law School poll from February 2022 found that 61% of Wisconsin voters supported marijuana legalization, with 31% opposed. Among Republicans, 51% supported legalization, while 42% opposed it. The inclusion of lean Republican voters helped push the overall Republican support to a majority, although those who strictly identified as Republicans were more opposed.

        "summary": "Sen. Melissa Agard (D-Madison) introduced a bill to fully legalize cannabis in Wisconsin for both medicinal and recreational use. Agard emphasized the readiness of Wisconsin residents, including farmers and communities impacted by outdated drug policies, for legalization. She pointed to widespread support for cannabis reform, with a 2019 poll showing nearly 60% of Wisconsinites supporting full legalization and 83% supporting medical marijuana. Despite this, Republican leaders oppose full legalization, with some expressing openness to medicinal use only. Agardâ€™s bill proposes legalizing up to 2 ounces and six plants, with tax revenues funding community reinvestment grants for underserved communities, particularly addressing racial disparities. Agard's bill also includes a path for expunging records of individuals convicted of certain cannabis-related offenses. She argued that Wisconsin is losing tax revenue to neighboring states with legalized cannabis and called for Wisconsin to capitalize on the economic benefits of the industry, including opportunities for small farmers.",

        "summary": "'Legalizing Marijuana Gaining Momentum in Wisconsin' Support for marijuana legalization in Wisconsin is growing, with bipartisan backing for bills to legalize medical and recreational marijuana. While the push is gaining momentum, lawmakers have stated that legalization won't occur this year. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley noted that the state is closer than ever to relaxing its marijuana laws, with all neighboring states having some form of marijuana legalization. Wisconsin has bills from both Democrats and Republicans, including a bipartisan proposal to decriminalize marijuana possession. Although Democratic Governor Tony Evers proposed legalizing marijuana in his budget last year, Republicans in the Legislature removed the provision. Nonetheless, conversations about joining the 37 states with legalized medical marijuana and the 18 that have fully legalized it, including Illinois and Michigan, are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu and other Republicans have expressed opposition, with LeMahieu advocating for federal rather than state-level legalization. However, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos supports medical marijuana. Democratic Senator Melissa Agard, a strong advocate for full legalization, remains optimistic, emphasizing that legislation is not a matter of 'if' but 'when and how.' She stressed that despite challenges, Wisconsin is making progress in having more conversations about marijuana reform across political lines.",
        "snippet": "The push to legalize marijuana in Wisconsin enjoys some bipartisan support, but backers of bills that would make it legal for either medical or recreational use say it wont happen this year."

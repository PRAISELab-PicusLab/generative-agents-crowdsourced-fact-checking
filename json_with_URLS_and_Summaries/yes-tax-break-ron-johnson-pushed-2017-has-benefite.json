        "summary": "'The tax carve-out (Ron) Johnson spearheaded overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest, over small businesses', stated by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin in 2022, is accurate. Multiple studies and reports show that the pass-through tax break Johnson supported in 2017 disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans. Research, including from the National Bureau of Economic Research and ProPublica, found that the top 1% of income earners received nearly 60% of the tax savings, with the ultra-wealthy receiving the largest share. In contrast, small business owners, who earn much less, received minimal benefits. The claim is rated as True.",

        "summary": "Ron Johnson defends his role in securing a pass-through tax provision in the 2017 tax cuts, which was criticized for benefiting wealthy donors, including Dick and Liz Uihlein of Uline and Diane Hendricks of ABC Supply. ProPublica reported that these donors received millions in tax deductions, while Treasury economists found that the top 1% of earners gained the majority of the tax savings from this provision. Johnson stated that his support for the measure aimed to help small businesses compete with large corporations, not to benefit donors. Critics, including Democrats and political watchdogs, accused Johnson of corruption and prioritizing the interests of wealthy donors over middle-class families, with some describing the provision as a clear example of quid-pro-quo politics.

        "summary": "'Democrats attack Ron Johnson over tax breaks and abortion in salvo of primary day ads' Democrats are launching TV and digital ads attacking Senator Ron Johnson, accusing him of benefiting his donors and himself with tax breaks. The ads suggest that Johnson, who has spent much time in Washington, is out of touch with ordinary voters. The TV ad features a narrator accusing Johnson of delivering a $215 million tax break to billionaires, referencing a 2021 ProPublica investigation. Johnson admitted that his business and donors benefited from the 2017 Republican tax bill but emphasized that 90% of businesses gained from it. Additionally, digital ads highlight Johnson's stance on abortion, with one ad stating, “He doesn’t understand your family, or care about you.” These attacks are part of Democrats' broader strategy ahead of the general election, where they aim to weaken Johnson's bid for a third term",

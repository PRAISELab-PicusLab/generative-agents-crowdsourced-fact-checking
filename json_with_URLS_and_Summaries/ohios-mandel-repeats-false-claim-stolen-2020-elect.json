        "summary": "Josh Mandel, an Ohio Senate candidate and former state treasurer, falsely claimed during a debate that the 2020 election was 'stolen from Donald J. Trump' a statement which was met with applause at the evangelical Genoa Baptist Church event. Mandel was among other GOP candidates including Matt Dolan, J.D. Vance, Jane Timken, Mike Gibbons, and Bernie Moreno. His remarks align with the baseless 'Big Lie' narrative of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, despite no evidence. Political analysts criticized Mandel's stance, viewing it as pandering to the Republican base. Additionally, Mandel argued against the separation of church and state, suggesting schools instill faith, and expressed willingness to govern using the Bible alongside the Constitution.",

        "summary": "The claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump has been a focal point of U.S. political discourse, primarily from some on the right. These individuals argue that the election was manipulated through voter fraud, biased media, and 'deep-state' efforts. However, no evidence of widespread voter fraud has been found to substantiate claims of a stolen election. Legal efforts to overturn the results, including multiple lawsuits, have failed due to a lack of evidence. Media on the left often dismiss the claims, emphasizing the absence of significant fraud, while those on the right argue that changes to election laws, particularly regarding mail-in voting, facilitated fraud or unfair practices. Some also contend that media bias and social media censorship influenced the election in Biden’s favor. Despite this, the election results have been consistently upheld, with audits confirming Biden’s victory. The term “stolen election” varies in meaning, with some viewing it as related solely to voter fraud, while others include broader factors like media bias or election law changes. As of now, there is no evidence to suggest the election results were fraudulently altered.",
        "snippet": "The claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump has underscored most political discourse in the U.S. for over a year. There is no evidence that voter fraud led to Trumps defeat. But some on the right and elsewhere hold a broader definition of stolen in this case. What Left-Rated Media Does"

        "summary": "In the 2022 elections, the false claim of a 'stolen 2020 election' is prominently featured due to candidates across the U.S. who endorse this narrative. This includes races for governors, secretaries of state, and congressional positions. Former President Donald Trump continues to promote the idea that the election was stolen and has influenced Republican candidates who align with this belief. In particular, these claims have energized races for secretary of state in key battleground states that narrowly supported Biden in 2020, and Trump has endorsed candidates like Mark Finchem in Arizona and Jody Hice in Georgia who support the false narrative. Democrats label GOP candidates promoting these claims as propagators of 'the Big Lie.' Despite a lack of evidence, the belief persists among many Republicans, which may impact future elections. Figures like Steve Bannon have emphasized these claims as a 'litmus test' for Republican candidates in 2022. Despite concerns about potential voter demobilization, experts like Nate Persily argue these claims serve more to unify a political tribe than to dissuade participation.",

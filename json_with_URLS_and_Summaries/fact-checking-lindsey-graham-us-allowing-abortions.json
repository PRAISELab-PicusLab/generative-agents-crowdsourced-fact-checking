        "title": "Sen. Graham Introduces Popular Limit on Abortion After Five Months ...",
        "summary": "U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham introduced the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, known as 'Micah's Law' in the Senate. The legislation aims to ban abortions after five months of pregnancy, based on scientific evidence suggesting unborn children at this stage can feel pain. The bill had already passed the House of Representatives. A poll by the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) showed significant support for the bill among voters in Senate battleground states, particularly those represented by Democratic Senators who face re-election. The poll indicated that a majority of voters would be less likely to support Senators who favor late-term abortions. The bill has received advocacy from pro-life groups and President Donald Trump, who committed to signing it into law.",
        "snippet": "Voters agree: its inexplicable that the United States is one of only seven nations in the world to allow abortion after 20 weeks  five months, ... Now its time for the pro-life majority in the Senate, led by pro-life champion Lindsey Graham, to force vulnerable pro-abortion Senators up in 2018 to either stand with their pro-life ..."

        "summary": "Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch pro-life advocate, has consistently pushed for legislation limiting abortion rights. He emphasizes that the U.S. is one of seven nations worldwide allowing abortions on demand at 20 weeks and has sponsored bills to ban most abortions at this stage, with exceptions for rape, incest, or threats to the mother’s life. Graham supports defunding organizations like Planned Parenthood, advocating reallocating funds to women’s healthcare excluding abortion services. He also supports the Mexico City policy, barring U.S. funding for overseas organizations that promote abortion. Graham authored the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which recognizes harm to a fetus during federal crimes. He consistently votes in favor of legislation limiting abortion access, including restrictions on partial-birth abortions and transporting minors across state lines for abortions. Rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee, he holds a pro-life stance, opposing measures expanding embryonic stem cell research or funding for family planning linked to abortion. During the 2020 South Carolina Senate debate, Lindsey Graham stated that the United States is one of only seven nations in the world that allows abortion on demand at 20 weeks. This claim aligns with the widely cited statistic regarding abortion laws worldwide.",

        "summary": "The United States is one of seven countries that allow elective abortions past 20 weeks. The other six countries include Canada, China, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam. Most other countries limit non-medically necessary abortions to the first trimester, or 12 weeks. An analysis by the Charlotte Lozier Institute confirms that the U.S. is part of a small percentage of countries with permissive abortion policies after 20 weeks. The findings were noted in context with the House vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which aims to make most elective abortions past 20 weeks illegal, with some exceptions.",
        "snippet": "The institute found the U.S. is one of only seven countries that allow abortion for any reason, or elective abortions, after 20 weeks.

        "summary": "Seven countries—Canada, China, Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam—permit elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, as confirmed by reports from both anti-abortion and pro-abortion rights groups. These nations allow abortions without restrictions as to reason, but specific laws and access vary widely. For example, the U.S. lacks a federal gestational limit, though most states impose restrictions, while Canada and China also lack federal limits, but local practices differ. Some of these countries restrict abortions after 24 weeks to particular circumstances, such as fetal anomalies or threats to the woman's health. Although this claim simplifies complex abortion laws, it is supported by verified data.",

        "summary": "The article from LifeNews.com, authored by Melanie Israel, discusses two pro-life bills being voted on in the U.S. Senate. The first is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which aims to ban elective abortions after 20 weeks, a point purportedly when a fetus can feel pain. The U.S. is among seven countries that allow such late-term abortions. The second bill is the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which mandates medical care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Opponents argue that such scenarios are rare and existing laws are sufficient. Despite widespread public support, these bills face opposition from pro-abortion groups like Planned Parenthood and often fail to pass in the Senate. The article argues that these bills should not be controversial and highlights the current disconnect between federal policy and public opinion.",
        "snippet": "The U.S. is one of only seven countries in the world that allows elective abortion past 20 weeks (5 months), alongside countries like China and North Korea. Scientific evidence suggests that by 20 weeks, a baby is capable of feeling excruciating pain during an abortion procedure."

        "title": "Lindsey Graham Says Abortion Isn't Constitutional Right",
        "summary": "Sen. Lindsey Graham stated that abortion is not a constitutional right and should be decided by states rather than judges. He criticized Roe v. Wade for creating a constitutional right not explicitly written in the Constitution, which he said has caused division since 1973. Graham asserted that the U.S. is one of seven countries allowing abortion on demand at 20 weeks of pregnancy and vowed Congress would remain involved in the issue. He emphasized that overturning Roe v. Wade would empower voters to influence abortion laws through elected officials, unlike the current system. Graham also predicted that abortion debates would not dominate the 2022 elections, as economic issues like inflation and border security are more pressing for Americans. Additionally, he commented on Russia's war in Ukraine, supporting NATO expansion and a decisive victory for Ukraine to ensure Europe's independence from Russian energy and to hold Putin accountable as a war criminal.",
        "snippet": "According to Graham, the United States is one of seven nations in the world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks, the fifth month in pregnancy. Congress will continue to debate this issue, they will finally have control over this, he said of a bombshell draft majority opinion leak that suggests SCOTUS would overturn Roe v. Wade."

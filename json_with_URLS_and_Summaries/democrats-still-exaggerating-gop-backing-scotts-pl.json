        "summary": "The Republican Study Committee, with Sen. Rick Scott, is promoting a plan to increase taxes on millions of Americans and phase out Social Security and Medicare. The proposal suggests that if the GOP gains majorities, middle-income households would see a tax hike averaging $450, contributing an additional $100 billion in federal taxes in 2022 alone. Over 80% of this tax increase would impact households earning about $54,000 or less, with 97% affecting those earning under $100,000. House Democrats have passed legislation aimed at cost reduction and inflation control despite GOP resistance. Voters are encouraged to inquire where congressional candidates stand on Scott’s plan, as Democrats endeavor to reduce costs while Republicans support a taxing strategy impacting middle and lower-income families.",
        "snippet": "Thursday, June 23, 2022 Yesterday, the Republican Study Committee met with Sen. Rick Scott again as he pitched them to back his plan to raise taxes on millions of Americans and sunset away essential programs like Social Security and Medicare. 158 House Republicans sit on the committee including several vulnerable incumbents."

        "title": "Fact check: Do Senate Republicans want to 'end' Medicare, Social Security?",
        "summary": "A claim by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in a television ad states that Senate Republicans want to 'end' Medicare and Social Security. This is based on an 11-point agenda by Sen. Rick Scott, which proposes that all federal legislation, including these programs, should sunset within five years unless Congress renews them. This idea allows for the possibility of these programs being terminated if not renewed. However, key Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have rejected parts of Scott's proposal, and Scott’s plan does not reflect a collective position of Senate Republicans. Therefore, the claim that Senate Republicans broadly aim to end these programs is rated as mostly false, as it misrepresents Scott's individual proposal as a party-wide agenda.",

        "summary": "Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson recently called Senator Rick Scott's (FL-R) legislative plan to raise taxes and eliminate Social Security 'a positive thing', expressing agreement with most of Scott's 11-point plan. The plan would increase taxes on over half of Americans, including 32% of Wisconsinites, and sunset all federal legislation within five years. This could lead to the elimination of Social Security and significant health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid unless reauthorized by a Republican-controlled Senate. Throughout his career, Johnson has been consistently opposed to federal programs like those potentially affected by the Scott plan.",

        "summary": "Rick Scott, a prominent Republican figure, is promoting a plan that includes raising taxes on low-income Americans, ending Social Security and Medicare, and increasing pollution and corporate profits. This plan proposes that working-class people, who already face significant financial burdens, should be taxed more, while wealthier individuals could benefit from reduced taxes. Scott, supported by some media such as Fox News, is positioning himself for a potential presidential run in 2024. His proposals have been met with criticism, highlighting concerns for the financial wellbeing of the majority of Americans. This initiative is part of a larger Republican agenda that critics argue has consistently favored the wealthy over the working class.",

        "summary": "Democrats have claimed that Republican Sen. Rick Scott's proposal would 'end' Social Security and Medicare. Scott's plan involves sunsetting all federal legislation every five years, allowing Congress to reevaluate and renew necessary laws. While these programs would be subject to this review, Scott asserts his intention is to 'review', 'fix', and 'preserve' them rather than eliminate them. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that Republicans, if they gain Senate control, would not pursue sunsetting these programs. However, some Democrats have exaggerated Scott's plan to imply a broader Republican agenda to dismantle the social safety net, despite lacking widespread GOP support.",

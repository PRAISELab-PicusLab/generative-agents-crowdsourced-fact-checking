        "title": "WisGOP: State crime lab efficiency plummets under Josh Kaul",
        "summary": "Under Josh Kaul's leadership, the efficiency of the Wisconsin state crime lab has significantly decreased. Despite the legislature's increased funding, the lab has struggled with longer turnaround times for crime scene reports, DNA analysis, and processing of controlled substances, even though they are handling fewer cases. This issue persists despite Kaul's criticism of his predecessor, Brad Schimel, during his campaign. Wisconsin Right Now's report indicates that the crime lab's diminished performance has been a trend since before COVID-19 and has not seen improvement under Kaul. Although he has cited numerous reasons for these delays, including inherited backlogs and the pandemic's impact, the overall effectiveness of the crime lab has worsened compared to Schimel's tenure. There is a call for accountability as Kaul's efforts have not addressed these challenges effectively.",
        "snippet": "August 12, 2021. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has failed on public safety, with crime lab delays worse in key areas  like guns and DNA  than those under former Republican AG Brad Schimel. Even though Schimels crime lab was more productive and effective, he was hammered relentlessly by Kaul and the news media."

        "summary": "Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has released crime lab testing data that Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney describes as revealing 'staggering' failures. Toney criticizes Kaul for mismanaging the crime lab, accusing him of limiting evidence submissions in a political move to enhance turnaround times. Despite testing fewer items than his predecessor, Brad Schimel, Kaul is said to take longer on several key testing categories, including DNA. Toney and Kaul are both contenders for the State Attorney General position.",
        "snippet": "April 18, 2022. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul released his crime lab testing data last week, and according to Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, the failures are staggering.. Toney said Kaul has campaigned on fixing crime but is trying to bury his abysmal failure on mismanaging the crime lab.."

        "summary": "Eric Toney, the Fond du Lac County District Attorney and a Republican candidate for state Attorney General, criticized Democratic AG Josh Kaul, labeling him as 'a miserable failure' and 'incompetent' regarding the state crime lab management. Toney referenced an investigative report by Wisconsin Right Now, which showed increased delays in processing evidence such as guns and DNA under Kaul's tenure, compared to his predecessor. Toney argued that Kaul's leadership failures in public safety extend beyond the crime lab, citing unfilled DCI leadership positions and cuts to the DOJ’s criminal prosecution unit. He accused Kaul of being influenced by a far-left anti-police agenda and advocated for a prosecutor, rather than a politician, to lead the DOJ. Toney is running against Ryan Owens in the Republican AG primary, and he is backed by various law enforcement figures. Following the investigative report, Owens also criticized Kaul’s management of the state crime lab.",
        "snippet": "In a press release, Toney, DA for almost nine years, cited Wisconsin Right Now's investigative report that shows that, on multiple key measurements, the crime lab's delays in processing key evidence like guns and DNA have increased under Kaul when compared to his predecessor Republican Brad Schimel. That's at a time of soaring crime. Yet Kaul ..."

        "summary": "ttorney General Josh Kaul's crime lab is processing fewer cases and taking longer to analyze key evidence compared to his predecessor, Brad Schimel. Kaul's lab handled 9,297 cases in 2021, a significant drop from 12,680 cases in 2018 under Schimel. In areas like DNA analysis, controlled substances, and toxicology, Kaul’s lab processed fewer cases and had longer turnaround times. For example, Kaul's lab took 128 days for DNA analysis in 2021, while Schimel’s lab averaged 80 days in 2018. Kaul's office also reduced the types of cases accepted, contributing to the lower caseload. Despite a legislative investment in the crime labs, Kaul's office struggled with delays and mismanagement, with critiques from DA Eric Toney accusing Kaul of limiting case submissions to artificially reduce the backlog. The report shows that while Kaul's office improved in some areas, like latent footwear analysis, it still faced significant challenges compared to Schimel's performance. According to the summary, Kaul's crime lab is testing significantly fewer items than his predecessor, Brad Schimel, and it is taking longer to test many key items, including DNA. so the statment 'The state crime lab under Attorney General Josh Kaul is testing significantly less items than former AG Brad Schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to Schimel including DNA' can be considered true ",
        "snippet": "Attorney General Josh Kauls crime lab is taking in far fewer cases than his predecessor Brad Schimel even as violent crime skyrockets throughout the state, yet is taking longer to process them in key areas like DNA analysis and controlled substances, Kauls own numbers show."

Toney criticized Kaul for leaving key leadership positions unfilled and reducing resources for law enforcement. He attributed these issues to Kaul's alignment with anti-police agendas.

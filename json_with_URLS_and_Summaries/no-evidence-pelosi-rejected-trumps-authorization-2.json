        "title": "Trump wanted troops to protect his supporters at Jan. 6 rally",
        "summary": "Former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller testified that on January 3, 2021, President Donald Trump expressed a desire for National Guard troops in Washington to protect his supporters during a rally planned for January 6. Trump asked whether the District of Columbia mayor had requested such troops and directed Miller to fulfill the request, emphasizing the protection of demonstrators' constitutional rights. However, Miller noted that the military response on January 6 was deliberately restrained due to concerns that deploying troops could raise fears of a military coup or martial law. During the rally, which escalated into an attack on the U.S. Capitol, five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died. Miller's testimony came during a House Oversight Committee hearing investigating security failures before and during the riot.",

        "summary": "Fox News has repeated the false claim that former President Donald Trump requested 20,000 National Guard troops to secure the Capitol on January 6, 2021. This claim has been debunked by multiple fact-checkers, with no evidence supporting that Trump made such an official request. The myth originated shortly after the January 6 insurrection, with Trump stating in a Fox News interview that he supposedly requested 10,000 troops. However, it was revealed that no record of such an order exists and neither the Pentagon nor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office received any notification about it. The false narrative purports to recast Trump as a victim of a deep state conspiracy, despite evidence indicating his integral role in planning to overturn the 2020 election results.",

        "title": "Hannity Repeats False Claim Trump Ordered 20,000 Soldiers - Mediaite",
        "summary": "Sean Hannity repeated a false claim that Donald Trump ordered 20,000 soldiers to maintain peace in Washington, D.C., ahead of the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, and that Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined this offer. Hannity and Kash Patel, a former acting chief-of-staff at the Department of Defense, insisted Trump authorized the use of National Guard troops, but such an order is not recorded by the Department of Defense. Reports suggest Trump mentioned needing 10,000 troops in a meeting, but it was not a formal deployment order. Comments by Trump's aides indicate no action was taken based on this remark, and there was no official request for soldiers that Pelosi could reject. The claim seems to have been exaggerated over time, with confusion possibly arising from Trump authorizing 20,000 troops for Joe Bidenâ€™s inauguration later that month.",

        "title": "Did Pelosi Prevent National Guard from Responding to Capitol Attack?",
        "summary": "The claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blocked the National Guard from responding to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, is false. Pelosi does not have control of the National Guard, as the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard reports directly to the President of the United States. Despite suggestions by some Republicans, including Kevin McCarthy, blaming Pelosi, both she and other officials have stated that she did not prevent the deployment of the National Guard. Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, clarified that she supported the deployment when it was recommended on the afternoon of January 6th. Testimonies from officials involved in the events of January 6th, including the then-U.S. Capitol Police chief and sergeants-at-arms, did not indicate any interference by Pelosi in the National Guard's response. Additionally, Major General William Walker testified that the delay in deploying the National Guard was due to unusual restrictions imposed by the Defense Department, not any action by Pelosi. The Army only approved the Capitol Police's request for military support hours after it was first made, delaying the National Guard's response until the evening.",

        "summary": "On January 6, 2021, as Congress convened to count the Electoral College votes affirming Joe Biden's victory, a violent mob of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol. This chaos resulted in four deaths, including a woman shot by Capitol Police, and forced the evacuation of lawmakers. The riot followed a rally where Trump falsely claimed a stolen election and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. Consequently, there were calls, even from business and political leaders, for Vice President Mike Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Twitter suspended Trump's account for repeatedly amplifying conspiracy theories about the election. Post-riot, Congress reconvened and certified Biden's win despite some Republican objections. Simultaneously, Democrat Raphael Warnock was declared victor in Georgia's Senate runoff against Kelly Loeffler, while Jon Ossoff led David Perdue in a race that could transfer Senate control to Democrats. Consequently, calls for the peaceful transfer of power were emphasized.",

Furthermore, Pelosi did not have the authority over Capitol security, as the Capitol Police are overseen by the Capitol Police Board. Former House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving said discussions about the National Guard did not occur until January 6th. Additionally, reports confirm that Trump mentioned the number in conversation but did not make a formal request.

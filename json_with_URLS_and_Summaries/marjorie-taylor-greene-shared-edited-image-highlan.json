        "summary": "Marjorie Taylor Greene shared an edited image falsely claiming it depicted the Highland Park shooting suspect, Robert Crimo III, in 'jail or rehab or a psychiatric center' before the July 4 attack. Law enforcement detained Crimo after the shooting, which killed seven people and injured dozens. Despite Greene's claims, the image is noticeably altered, according to experts in digital forensics. There's no evidence supporting her assertion that the image shows Crimo in confinement prior to the shooting. The doctored photo circulated on Twitter before accounts allegedly related to Crimo or his stage name, 'Awake the Rapper' were suspended. Greene used the image to argue against blaming gun laws for mass shootings, implying Crimo's mental health history was a factor. Her claims were rated false by PolitiFact, a part of the Poynter Institute.",

        "title": "Photo altered to show July 4 shooting suspect in jail cell",
        "summary": "An image purportedly showing Robert Crimo, the suspect in the Highland Park July 4th shooting, in a jail cell holding a Bible has been confirmed as a manipulated photo. The Associated Press fact-checked and reported that the image is a composite, digitally inserting Crimo's image into a stock photo of a jail cell available online. This misinformation gained traction after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene shared it on social media, prompting discussions about its authenticity. The imagery is inconsistent, with signs of digital alteration such as differing lighting and quality between the elements. It was revealed that the altered image appeared online more than a year prior to the shooting. Crimo is accused of murdering seven and injuring dozens more by firing into a crowd from a rooftop. Despite past warnings of violence and suicide threats, he legally purchased the firearms used in the attack. This effort is part of AP’s commitment to counter misinformation by providing factual context.",

        "summary": "Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested on Facebook that the July 4th shooting in Highland Park was orchestrated by Democrats to encourage Republicans to support gun control measures. She pointed to the location and timing of the shootings as potential evidence of a plan to manipulate public opinion. Greene, known for her conspiracy theories, made statements that such ideas would be branded as right-wing conspiracy theories. The suspect, Robert Crimo III, who attended Trump rallies, was charged with seven counts of murder after legally obtaining a weapon despite prior police warnings. Greene reiterated her stance that gun control isn't the solution, blaming other factors like antidepressants and sharing doctored images to support her claims.",

        "summary": "Robert Crimo III, the suspect in the Highland Park shooting, pre-planned the attack for weeks, using women's clothing as a disguise to blend into the fleeing parade crowd after killing six people, according to police. He used an AR-15 -style rifle from a rooftop during the July 4 parade. Post-attack, he walked to his mother's house, with no evidence she was aware of his actions. Crimo was arrested after an eight-hour manhunt when a tip led police to his mother's car, which he was driving. He possessed legally purchased firearms, including another rifle at the time of arrest. His motive remains unclear. Crimo, whose father previously ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Highland Park, is an amateur rapper known as 'Awake the Rapper.' Despite his troubling online presence glorifying violence, his uncle saw no warning signs. The mass shooting left six adults dead and 38 people injured. Two victims identified were Nicholas Toledo, a 76-year-old grandfather, and Jacki Sundheim, a local synagogue member. President Biden condemned the shooting, highlighting ongoing issues with gun violence in the U.S.",

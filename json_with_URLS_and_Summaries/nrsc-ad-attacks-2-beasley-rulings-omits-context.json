        "title": "Fact Check: Claims in ad attacking Cheri Beasley's judicial rulings are ...",
        "summary": "In an ad targeting Cheri Beasley, claims were made about her judicial rulings when she was the North Carolina Chief Justice. The ad, funded by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, stated Beasley vacated the death sentence of a man who shot a 17-year-old and threw out the indictment of a sexual assault convict. The fact check clarifies that the death sentence was vacated because of the Racial Justice Act, not due to Beasley’s failure to protect victims. Robinson’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and ultimately upheld under Beasley's court due to concerns over double jeopardy, not the specifics of the crime. In the sexual assault case, the indictment was dismissed because it didn’t comply with the North Carolina law requiring the victim, a child, to be named, not because of Beasley's attitude towards crime itself. The ad was rated 'half-true' for omitting important contextual information.",

        "title": "Fact Check: Claims in ad attacking Cheri Beasley's judicial rulings are ...",
        "summary": "An ad attacking Cheri Beasley's judicial rulings claims she vacated the death sentence of a murderer and threw out an indictment in a sexual assault case. The fact check reveals these claims are partially true but lack context. Beasley was involved in a decision where Marcus Reymond Robinson's death sentence was converted to life imprisonment under the Racial Justice Act, and the ruling was about legal technicalities rather than guilt. In the second case, Michael Lee White's indictment was invalidated due to non-compliance with state law requirements for naming victims, not the merits of the case. Both cases were described in the ad in a misleading manner, omitting important details that would alter the perception of Beasley's rulings.",

        "title": "TV Ads About Cheri Beasleys Record on Violent Crime Lack Context",
        "summary": "The North Carolina U.S. Senate race features competing TV ads regarding Democrat Cheri Beasley’s record on violent crime during her time as chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) aired ads claiming Beasley was weak on crime, citing cases where she reduced sentences or dismissed charges. The Senate Majority PAC, supporting Beasley, countered with ads defending her record, claiming she was tough on crime. Key cases include: Marcus Reymond Robinson: Beasley’s court ruled that Robinson’s death sentence was unconstitutional after it was found that racial bias affected his trial. Robinson’s sentence was reinstated to life in prison after the state Supreme Court determined that re-imposing the death penalty violated double jeopardy protections. Michael Lee White: Beasley’s court ruled that White’s conviction for sexual assault of a child must be retried due to a technical error in his indictment, which did not properly name the victim. While the NRSC ad claimed she “threw out the indictment,” Beasley’s ruling was based on a legal interpretation of state law. This claim is partially true as Beasley’s decision was a legal technicality rather than a dismissal of the case itself. Eric Glenn Lane: Beasley’s court denied Lane’s request for post-conviction DNA testing in a 2005 case where he was convicted of kidnapping, raping, and murdering a 5-year-old girl. Despite Lane’s appeal, Beasley’s court upheld the conviction, citing overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Both ads provide partial views of these cases, with the NRSC emphasizing Beasley’s decisions as soft on crime and the Senate Majority PAC defending her record as one of law and order.",

        "summary": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee's ad claims Cheri Beasley vacated a murderer’s death sentence and threw out an indictment in a child assault case. \n\n1. **Death Sentence Vacated:** The entire North Carolina Supreme Court, not just Beasley, vacated Marcus Reymond Robinson’s death sentence. Beasley wrote the majority opinion, which cited double jeopardy protections and legal precedent. The decision followed Robinson’s use of the Racial Justice Act, which allowed his death sentence to be commuted to life without parole after evidence of racial bias in jury selection. The act was later repealed, but the court ruled reinstating the death penalty violated legal protections.\n\n2. **Child Assault Case Indictment Dismissal:** The court dismissed an indictment against Michael Lee White, convicted of sexually assaulting a 7-year-old, due to a legal technicality. Beasley’s opinion noted the indictment was defective for identifying the victim only as “Victim 1” instead of using her initials or a similar identifier, as required by state law.\n\nSupporters of Beasley, including six county sheriffs, called the attacks misleading and highlighted her adherence to the Constitution and rule of law.",

        "summary": "A GOP ad claims that Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasley 'vacated' a death sentence and 'threw out' an indictment in a child assault case, accusing her of being soft on crime. The ad partially reflects her judicial actions but lacks context. In the death sentence case, Beasley ruled against re-imposing the death penalty on Marcus Robinson, who had already been moved to a life sentence due to racial bias issues in his initial trial. Her ruling did not affect his imprisonment status. In the child assault case, Beasley was part of a ruling that vacated a conviction because the indictment failed to meet legal requirements. The ad omits reasons behind these decisions, which challenge its claim that she failed to protect victims. The assertions in the ad are rated as 'Half True' due to lack of context.",

        "title": "What has DeSantis said about the Jan. 6 insurrection? - Tampa Bay Times",
        "summary": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has addressed the January 6 Capitol riot on several occasions, contrary to claims made by U.S. Representative Charlie Crist. On the day of the riot, DeSantis condemned the violence, stating that rioting or violence of any kind is unacceptable and that perpetrators must face legal consequences. He reiterated this stance the following day during a coronavirus briefing, emphasizing that such actions are wrong regardless of political affiliation. While Crist accused DeSantis of not condemning the riot or calling it an insurrection, DeSantis has criticized media coverage of the event and disputed labeling it as an insurrection in comparison to terrorist attacks like September 11. Despite his criticism of the media narrative, DeSantis maintained that individuals obstructing proceedings needed to be held accountable. PolitiFact rated Crist's claim that DeSantis hasn't condemned the insurrection as false.",

        "summary": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis criticized the national media for what he called an 'obsession' with the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. He accused them of trying to 'milk' the event to smear supporters of former President Donald Trump, likening the media's fixation to their version of 'Christmas.' DeSantis suggested that Florida voters are more concerned with issues like inflation and gas prices rather than the Capitol attack. He dismissed comparisons to the September 11 attacks as insulting and pointed out the relatively brief coverage of the 2017 congressional baseball practice shooting as an example of media bias. DeSantis also mentioned that no one has been charged with inciting an insurrection in relation to the Capitol attack. The governor, who is considering a 2024 presidential run, emphasized that he does not find the January 6 events a priority for his constituents.",

Ron DeSantis condemning the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 but noted that he has not referred to the event as an 'insurrection.' DeSantis has made few references to the riots despite Florida's significant involvement, with the state having the largest number of arrests related to the attack. Charlie Crist has repeatedly claimed that DeSantis has not condemned the insurrection, emphasizing this on Twitter. A review of Google and Nexis databases did not uncover additional direct condemnations by DeSantis, and his comments have focused on the violence rather than explicitly addressing the 'insurrection' or the 'Big Lie.'",

        "summary": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has issued statements condemning the violence of the January 6 Capitol riots, expressing support for law enforcement efforts. However, he has downplayed the severity of the riots, criticizing media coverage and likening the focus on January 6 to exaggerated comparisons with significant events like September 11. DeSantis has distanced himself from former President Donald Trump, potentially avoiding his endorsement, while still aligning with Trump in dismissing the seriousness of the January 6 hearings. Despite neither officially announcing presidential bids for 2024, DeSantis and Trump are seen as frontrunners in the Republican primary, and DeSantis could benefit from Trump’s legal challenges stemming from the January 6 investigations. The hearings have presented evidence implicating Trump in attempts to overturn the 2020 election, risking possible legal proceedings or an election ban.",

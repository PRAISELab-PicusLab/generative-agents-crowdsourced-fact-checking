        "summary": "New York experienced the largest population loss in the U.S. between 2020 and 2021, with a decrease of 319,020 residents or 1.6%, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. This was the highest numeric and percentage loss among all states. While New York had the most significant overall population decline, it was second to California for the number of residents moving out and third after Florida and Texas for net gains from international migration. The U.S. overall saw its slowest population growth rate ever, at 0.1%, due to decreased immigration, reduced birth rates, and increased death rates from the pandemic. The Bureau noted that population growth has been slowing due to lower birth rates and declining international migration, compounded by rising mortality rates. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo indicated potential legal actions after New York lost a congressional seat due to these shifts, falling short by 89 residents. The state's number of congressional districts reduced from 27 to 26.",

        "summary": "New York does lead the nation in population loss. U.S. Census Bureau data indicates that between July 2020 and July 2021, New York experienced a population decline of 1.58%, the largest percentage loss of any state. The state's population fell from 20.15 million to 19.84 million, marking a decrease of 319,000 people. This decline was primarily due to residents moving to other states, as well as a reduction in immigration due to pandemic-related travel controls. Despite this short-term decline, New York's population grew by an average of 0.42% annually between the 2010 and 2020 censuses. Lee Zeldin's statement that New York leads the U.S. in population loss is rated as true based on these findings.",

        "title": "Fewer Younger Adults Drives Population Loss in Some U.S. Cities",
        "summary": "Population loss in some U.S. cities' central counties in 2021 is mainly due to a decline in younger adults, specifically those in their early 20s to mid-30s. Census data indicates that areas such as New York-Newark-Jersey City, San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, and Boston-Cambridge-Newton experienced significant reductions in this age group. New York County saw a 13.6% decline in the 20-34 age group compared to a 6.6% total population decrease. Similarly, San Francisco County reported a 15.5% drop in the same age group versus a 6.3% overall population decrease, while Suffolk County's decline was 5.7% compared to a 3% total decrease. Other cities like Philadelphia and St. Louis had smaller losses, with the young adult population declining less drastically compared to their total populations. The reduction is linked to domestic migration, likely influenced by the pandemic, allowing remote work and prompting relocations to areas with lower costs or better living conditions. Despite the declines, these counties still hold a larger share of younger working-age adults compared to the national average.",
        "snippet": "By July 2021, although this age group was still large in the grand scheme of the population, its male and female peaks in New York County show the most marked loss of all age groups. For example, New York Countys population declined by 6.6% from July 1, 2020-2021, but the population ages 20-34 declined by 13.6%  twice the countys rate."

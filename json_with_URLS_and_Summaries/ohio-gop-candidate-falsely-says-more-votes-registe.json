        "summary": "A report claims that US Census data revealed a discrepancy in the 2020 presidential election votes. The Census Bureau's data indicates that 154,628,000 people self-reported as having voted, whereas the official tally was over 158 million, showing nearly a four million vote difference. The report suggests this is unusual, as historical data typically aligns more closely, and postulates that five million ballots might be questionable. The article emphasizes skepticism towards the official election results, hinting at potential voting discrepancies linked to certain ballots while urging readers to verify the discrepancies via the Census Bureau's website.",
        "snippet": "Here is the headline: Census reveals weird anomaly: Shows millions less voted in 2020 election than official tally Ã¢Â€Â¦ May 4, 2021  The Election Wizard US Census data released last week called into question the official vote tally from the 2020 election.As part of the Census, the government collects data on citizens who self-report as having voted in presidential elections."

        "summary": "The U.S. Census Bureau released the 'Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2020' report, highlighting a record turnout with 154.6 million voters compared to 137.5 million in 2016. This election saw increased use of nontraditional voting methods, with 69.4% of voters utilizing mail or early voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain demographics, such as those aged 45 and older, non-Hispanic Whites, and those with higher education, were overrepresented in voter turnout. Concerns about COVID-19 affected a small percentage of nonvoters' decisions. The report provides insights into the social and demographic changes in the voter population over time.",
        "snippet": "Email. FEB. 17, 2022  The 2020 presidential election featured record turnout and record use of nontraditional voting methods, according to the  Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2020  report released today by the U.S. Census Bureau.

        "summary": "Joe Hoft and Bill Binney, writing for We the People Convention, allege that the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election was fraudulent, claiming Joe Biden received 13 million more votes than there were eligible voters. They cite data suggesting 213.8 million registered voters, with a 66.2% voter turnout, equating to 141.5 million actual voters. If Trump received 74 million votes, they argue only 67.5 million votes could have gone to Biden, indicating additional illegitimate ballots. The article asserts this supports claims of widespread voter fraud.",
        "snippet": "If we have 213.8 million registered voters in the US and 66.2% of all voters voted in the 2020 election, that equals 141.5 voters who voted in the 2020 election (Binney shows 140 million which is materially the same). If President Trump won 74 million votes, then that leaves only 67.5 million votes remaining for Biden."

        "summary": "Ohio GOP candidate Mike Gibbons falsely claimed that '5 million more people voted than were registered to vote' in the 2020 election, citing the U.S. Census Bureau. However, the Census Bureau reported that 168,308,000 were registered and 154,628,000 votes cast, indicating 13 million fewer votes than registered voters. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission, receiving data directly from state officials, found 43 million fewer votes were cast than registered voters, a far larger discrepancy than Gibbons' claim. Thus, Gibbons' statement was rated 'Pants on Fire' by PolitiFact for its inaccuracy. The actual number of votes was significantly less than registered voters, contradicting Gibbons' assertion.",

        "summary": "In the Ohio Senate race, GOP candidate Mike Gibbons falsely claimed there were '5 million more people voted than were registered to vote' according to the U.S. Census Bureau during the 2020 election. This claim is rated 'Pants on Fire' by PolitiFact, indicating it is inaccurate. The U.S. Census Bureau actually reported 13 million fewer votes than registered voters, based on survey estimates. In contrast, data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, working with state election officials, revealed that 48 million fewer votes were cast than the number of registered voters. Thus, Gibbons' assertion was incorrect by about 53 million votes. Data inconsistencies across reports may arise from voter registration nuances, such as same-day registration, which complicates direct comparisons.",

        "summary": "The U.S. Census Bureau released new tables showing that the 2020 presidential election had the highest voter turnout of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens voting. The data, derived from the 2020 Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement, highlight voting patterns by race, age, education, and income. Asian voter turnout hit a record high of 59.7%, and more women (68.4%) voted than men (65.0%). Voter turnout increased with age, educational attainment, and income, peaking at 76.0% for those aged 65-74. Despite COVID-19, 155 million people voted; however, 552,500 registered nonvoters cited pandemic concerns. Registration was most common at motor vehicle departments, and veterans voted more than nonveterans. The Census Bureau has collected such data since 1964 to understand voter demographics.",
        "snippet": "For people whose income was $100,000-$149,999, turnout was 81.0%, while for people whose income was $30,000-$39,999, turnout was 63.6%. Despite COVID-19 concerns, 155 million people turned out for the 2020 presidential election. However, 4% (552,500) of registered nonvoters reported not voting due to their concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic."

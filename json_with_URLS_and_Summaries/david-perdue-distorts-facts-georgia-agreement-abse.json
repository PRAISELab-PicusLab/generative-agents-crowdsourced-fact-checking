        "title": "Fact Check: Trump Is Right, AP Wrong, About Georgia ... - Breitbart",
        "summary": "The article discusses a fact-check controversy regarding President Donald Trump's claim about Georgia's signature matching process for absentee ballots. Trump stated that a March consent decree made it impossible for Georgia to check ballot signatures, which the Associated Press labeled as false. However, the author argues this claim is mostly true. The consent decree, linked to relaxed signature requirements from an earlier state law, complicates the process by requiring that a mismatched signature must be reviewed by three election officials, who must agree on the mismatch and sign the envelope. This labor-intensive procedure and the potential personal risk for officials due to fears of accusations of racial bias, make widespread signature checking unlikely despite official assertions of process strengthening. Trump's assertion, according to the article, aligns more closely with the practical challenges in the current signature verification process.",
        "snippet": "The consent decree describes a new procedure for reviewing signatures. When there is a mismatch, an election official must consult with two other officials. Then they have to vote. The ballot can only be rejected if a majority agrees that there is a mismatch."

        "title": "Heart of the Primaries 2022, Republicans-Issue 20 (April 28, 2022)",
        "summary": "The issue discusses multiple political events in the U.S. related to the 2022 primaries. In Ohio, former President Donald Trump endorses J.D. Vance for the U.S. Senate, despite the Club for Growth's opposition and anti-Vance ads highlighting his past criticisms of Trump. Trump's endorsement is significant but its effectiveness is uncertain. In South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, Rep. Joe Wilson endorses Katie Arrington against incumbent Nancy Mace. Arrington is criticized for past support of a tax increase, while Mace is faulted for her comments about Trump. In Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District, no candidate received the GOP endorsement after seven voting rounds. Jeremy Munson led but did not achieve the required 60% delegate support. David Perdue criticized Governor Brian Kemp's handling of the 2020 election in Georgia during the gubernatorial debate, asserting the election was rigged. Kemp defended his actions, abiding by law and constitution, despite claiming issues in the election. The Illinois gubernatorial primary sees major donations and campaign ads targeting candidates Darren Bailey and Richard Irvin over their past statements and political stances. The competitiveness of primaries in Montana and Mississippi is also discussed, with Montana's filing deadline passing on March 14 and Mississippi not holding state legislative elections in 2022.",
        "snippet": "Perdue said the consent decree invalidated all voter ID law Ã¢Â€Â¦ and allowed fraudulent ballots to be accepted into the race. The consent decree referred to a settlement that Raffensperger, the Georgia Democratic Party, and others not including Kemp signed in March 2020."

        "title": "Georgias Kemp accidentally tells the truth about anti-voting law",
        "summary": "Georgia Governor Brian Kemp inadvertently admitted that the state's Senate Bill 202, perceived as a voter suppression law, was a response to dissatisfaction with the 2020 election results, especially at the federal level. Kemp, facing a primary challenge from David Perdue endorsed by Donald Trump, acknowledged his frustration in a recent debate while discussing the law. The bill, passed amid allegations of fraud, restricted access to drop boxes, made absentee voting harder, and prohibited giving water to voters in line. Critics argue it empowers Republicans to influence the State Board of Elections and could discriminate against Democratic-leaning areas. Kemp's comments reveal an intent to alter voting outcomes rather than improve election administration, aligning with past Republican admissions of electoral scheme motives.",

        "summary": "Former U.S. Senator David Perdue incorrectly claimed that Georgia Governor Brian Kemp allowed 7.5 million ballots to be sent to every voter. In reality, in March 2020, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced that an application for an absentee ballot would be sent to all 6.9 million active registered voters for the June 2020 primary in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Raffensperger, not Kemp, was responsible for this decision, and he did not send out actual ballots, only applications. Voters still had the option to vote in person. Kemp played no role in this process, as the responsibility fell under the Georgia Secretary of State. Perdue's statement aligns with broader false claims suggesting Democratic manipulation through mail voting.",

        "summary": "Media Bias Fact Check published a series of fact checks, addressing various claims. David Perdue falsely claimed that a consent decree in Georgia invalidated voter ID laws and allowed fraudulent ballots during the 2020 race; PolitiFact rated this as 'Pants on Fire' because the decree didn't mention voter ID or involve Governor Brian Kemp. Kevin McCarthy's statement that the Attorney General labeled parents at school board meetings as 'terrorists' was rated false by The Washington Post. Melissa Agard correctly stated that cannabis reform is supported by the majority in Wisconsin, including Republicans, with Politifact confirming a poll showing 61% support. Contrary to Senator Martin Heinrich's claim, 32 Republicans voted for the Infrastructure bill. A social media post falsely claimed the Red Cross doesn't use vaccinated blood, which FactCheck.org refuted. Lastly, an Australian claim about a mind-control weapon used in the Gulf War was debunked by the Australian Associated Press.",

        "title": "Fact check: Partly false claim about Gov. Brian Kemp and 2018 election",
        "summary": "A claim suggests that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp \"stole\" the state's 2018 gubernatorial election through three actions: canceling 1.4 million voter registrations, closing 214 polling places mostly in nonwhite neighborhoods, and putting 53,000 voter registrations on hold, predominantly affecting Black voters. While Kemp's office canceled over 1.4 million registrations under \"voter roll maintenance\" and closed 214 polling places due to changes in law, counties independently decide on polling locations. Despite voter suppression claims, those actions are legally routine, with no substantial evidence indicating Kemp \"stole\" the election from Democrat Stacey Abrams. Although these actions might have deterred some voters, Abrams lost by nearly 55,000 votes, conceding that the outcome reflected voter suppression. Kemp and his spokesperson emphasized protecting legal voting integrity, while an expert noted the lack of empirical evidence of any malicious intent, viewing claims as politically strategic for voter mobilization. The overall claim is rated as partly false, as some accusations lack substantial support.",

        "summary": "A TV ad from the Get Georgia Right PAC claims that \"widespread illegal ballot harvesting\" was responsible for electing Georgia's two Democratic U.S. senators. FactCheck.org reports that these claims lack evidence. Georgia's secretary of state is investigating allegations of illegal ballot collection during the November 2020 and January 2021 elections, following a complaint by the group True the Vote. However, True the Vote has not claimed that the ballots were fraudulent or suggested which candidates benefitted. Their accusations rely on surveillance footage and geolocation data, but the Georgia Bureau of Investigation found the evidence insufficient for a full investigation. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is continuing the investigation but has not concluded that the alleged activities affected the elections' outcomes. The ad also criticizes Republican Governor Brian Kemp for not taking aggressive action on voter fraud claims. Kemp had rejected calls for a special legislative session to address election concerns, citing constitutional limitations and ongoing court challenges.",

        "summary": "President Donald Trump criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger for approving a consent decree related to mail-in ballots, alleging it hindered the ability to check signatures and was influenced by Democrat Stacey Abrams. The consent decree aimed to address concerns about disproportionate ballot rejections for minority voters by allowing them a chance to fix mismatches. Trump's tweets about election fraud claims were labeled disputed by Twitter. Political reporter Greg Bluestein and election attorney Marc Elias criticized Trump's claims, while UC Berkeley statistician Philip Stark supported concerns of disenfranchised minority voters. Meanwhile, known attorney L. Lin Wood filed a lawsuit against Raffensperger over changes to absentee ballot processes without legislative approval. Trump's accusations remain part of an unsubstantiated voter fraud narrative amidst ongoing legal challenges, including a recount in Georgia.",

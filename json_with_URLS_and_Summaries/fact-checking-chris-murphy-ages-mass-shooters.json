        "summary": "Sen. Chris Murphy claimed that 'most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old' in reference to mass shooters. PolitiFact rated this statement as Mostly True, particularly when considering school shootings alone. According to a Washington Post database, which includes over 200 school shooting incidents since 1999, the median age of school shooters is 16, with more than two-thirds being under 18. However, in the context of all mass shootings, academic studies indicate that about a quarter of shooters are younger than 25, but the proportion specifically aged 18-19 is not as prominent. The Washington Post analysis included non-lethal shootings, which could skew the results concerning the age of the offenders.",

        "summary": "In 2023, the United States recorded 3,013 murder offenders aged between 20 and 24, which was the highest number among all age groups. Conversely, there were seven offenders aged between one and four years. Overall, violent crime rates, particularly murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, have decreased significantly since 1990, even though they've seen a slight rise since 2014 without reaching the 1991 peak. The majority of murders were committed using firearms, reflecting the high gun ownership rate in the country. A significant number of murder offenses in 2023 involved offenders aged 17 to 19 (2,214) and 25 to 29 (2,233). Other age groups had varied numbers, with the number significantly tapering off as age increased. Notably, there were five offenders whose ages were unknown. These statistics capture a part of the broader issue of murder in the U.S., which is influenced by the accessibility of firearms.",

        "summary": "Democrat Senator Chris Murphy's speech against gun violence has gone viral, receiving over 1.5 million views. Following a recent school shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan, where three were killed and eight injured, Murphy criticized Republicans for not acting against gun violence. He condemned their focus on 'the sanctity of life' regarding abortion while ignoring gun-related deaths. Murphy emphasized the need to remove military-style weapons from streets and mandate background checks for gun purchases. He argued that the U.S. Senate's inaction sends a 'silent message of endorsement' to potential shooters.",

        "summary": "Mass shooters are increasingly younger, as highlighted by recent incidents in Buffalo and Uvalde, both involving 18-year-old perpetrators. Since 2018, most of the deadliest U.S. shootings have been committed by men aged 21 or younger. Historical data shows a shift; between 2012 and 2017, shooters were typically older, ranging from 26 to 64 years old. School shootings particularly involve younger attackers, aligning with FBI data indicating nearly half of 2020 homicides were committed by individuals under 30. There are distinct age clusters among mass shooters: older individuals (40s) often target workplaces, while younger perpetrators (18â€“21) may be influenced by social contagion. Federal law permits firearm purchases at 18, though some states set the limit at 21, and no law prevents gifting firearms to minors. Calls to raise the minimum age to 21 cite research showing the male brain's executive functions mature fully around 25. Lawmakers are considering reforms. A proposed bill by Sen. Feinstein would raise the age for purchasing assault weapons to 21, reflecting concerns about accessibility and developmental immaturity. While mental health issues, firearm access, and media coverage are potential contributors, studies debunk links between violent video games and mass shootings.",

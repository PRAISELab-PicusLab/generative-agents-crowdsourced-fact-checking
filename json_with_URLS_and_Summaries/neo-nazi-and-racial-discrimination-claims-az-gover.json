        "title": "Aaron Lieberman  Neo-Nazi and Racial Discrimination Claims in AZ ...",
        "summary": "In the Arizona gubernatorial race, a TV ad by former state Representative Aaron Lieberman made claims against candidates Kari Lake and Katie Hobbs. Lieberman alleged Lake participated in rallies with neo-Nazis and that Hobbs was found guilty of racial discrimination. These claims, however, are mostly exaggerated. Lake was reported to have posed with a Nazi sympathizer at campaign events, but there is no evidence she intentionally associated with neo-Nazis. Hobbs was involved in the 2015 firing of a Senate staffer who successfully sued for racial discrimination, but Hobbs herself was not specifically found guilty of it. The ad misrepresents the nuances of both situations.",
        "snippet": "The TV ad for former state Representative Aaron Lieberman, a Democrat, pitted the two frontrunners, Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs. Right now, Arizona politics is a dumpster fire, Lieberman said into the camera, as flames rose from a garbage container behind her. Kari Lake continues to appear at rallies with neo-Nazis."

        "summary": "Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has associated with far-right figures known for controversial and extremist views. During a campaign event, she was photographed with Ethan Schmidt-Crockett, a far-right activist, and Greyson Arnold, a self-proclaimed Nazi sympathizer. Lake has embraced individuals linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, publicly denying claims made by a QAnon promoter that they had dinner. A former TV anchor, Lake has gained support from far-right conspiracy theorists and promotes claims of election fraud. She has also appeared with and praised Republican figures involved with QAnon or who advocate for disproven election audits. Her campaign refutes the notion that Lake was knowingly associating with these controversial figures, stating she meets many individuals at events without prior background checks.",

        "summary": "Former FOX 10 anchor Kari Lake has become active on Gab, a social media platform known for hosting far-right and neo-Nazi content. Lake has been off the air since early 2021 due to medical leave, and while she did not provide extensive commentary, she joined Gab shortly after the shutdown of the far-right platform Parler. On Gab, she verified her account and engaged with content, including conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election. Gab has a history of facilitating hate speech and supporting extremist content, with its founder endorsing free speech without restrictions. This platform has been known for its community of white supremacists and QAnon followers. Lake, who had previously expressed right-wing views, has embraced some unfounded election-related conspiracy theories. This development raises questions about her media presence and affiliations within extremist online communities.",

        "summary": "Kari Lake, the Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate, accused her Democratic rival, Katie Hobbs, of being the 'real racist' and claimed that Hobbs was avoiding debates because she would be exposed as a 'twice-convicted racist.' Lake referred to a racial discrimination case in which Hobbs was found guilty, resulting in a $2.75 million settlement. Lake emphasized that Hobbs' conviction was not covered by mainstream media and criticized the left for labeling conservatives as racists while not addressing Hobbs' past.",

        "summary": "The claim that mass shootings tripled after the expiration of the assault weapon ban is rated as 'Mostly True,' according to PolitiFact. President Joe Biden stated that the 1994 federal assault weapon ban led to a decrease in mass shootings, and when it expired in 2004, mass shootings tripled. A 2019 study by New York University’s School of Medicine supports Biden's claim by showing a significant rise in mass shooting deaths after the ban ended. While it is difficult to definitively attribute the changes solely to the ban due to the number of weapons that remained in circulation, numerous studies link bans on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines to reductions in mass shooting fatalities. Researchers caution that the ban's impact is complex, but acknowledge the association between weapon restrictions and lower mass shooting occurrences.",

        "summary": "President Joe Biden claimed that mass shootings decreased after the 1994 assault weapons ban and tripled after it expired in 2004. Studies, such as a 2019 analysis by New York University’s School of Medicine, support Biden's statement, showing that mass shooting deaths slightly declined during the ban and rose sharply afterward. Researchers noted the effect of large-capacity magazines banned in 1994 as a factor in the death toll. However, the law was limited since millions of assault weapons and magazines remained in circulation. While some researchers urge caution in proving cause and effect, many associate weapon and magazine restrictions with fewer and less deadly mass shootings, supporting Biden's claim as 'Mostly True' according to PolitiFact.",

        "summary": "In a fact-check, President Joe Biden's claim that mass shootings tripled after the assault weapons ban ended in 2004 was evaluated. Biden's statement, which he made during a prime-time address following recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, was deemed mostly false. The claim is based on a study by Charles DiMaggio from NYU, suggesting an assault weapons ban could have prevented significant mass shooting deaths. However, this study has been critiqued and does not conclusively support Biden's claim. The Washington Post reported that there were 31 mass shootings in the decade before the 1994 law, 31 during its enforcement (1994-2004), and 47 in the decade after its expiration. Some of this increase may be attributed to population growth, and the Post left the claim unrated, as the evidence remains inconclusive. The assertion that mass shootings 'tripled' post-ban is considered speculative.",

        "title": "Assault weapon ban significantly reduces mass shooting",
        "summary": "A study by Northwestern Medicine highlights that the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (FAWB) from 1994 to 2004 significantly reduced public mass shootings, gun deaths, and injuries. The ban included restrictions on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. Researchers estimate that 10 mass shootings were prevented during the ban's decade, and 30 more could have been avoided if the ban hadn't expired. The FAWB's effectiveness is supported by evidence that access to rapid-fire weapons with large ammunition capacity is directly linked to mass shootings. The study underscores the need for policies addressing gun violence, emphasizing ongoing surveillance as crucial to testing and informing these policies. The FAWB is shown to not significantly impact other types of gun deaths, such as domestic homicides. The study's authors, including Lori Post, suggest that public health policies targeting assault weapons could effectively prevent mass shootings. Further research is planned into the mental health and personality disorders of shooters, differentiating between mental illness and behavioral issues such as narcissism and psychopathy.",

        "summary": "President Joe Biden faced heckling from Manuel Oliver, whose son was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting, during an event at the White House celebrating the passage of the Safer Communities Act. Oliver interrupted Biden's remarks, demanding more action on gun control. Biden, while acknowledging Oliver’s grief and agreeing with his call for further action, continued his speech advocating for a ban on assault weapons, referencing the expired 2004 ban. Despite little action from Congress, Biden expressed hope that public outrage over mass shootings would encourage lawmakers to reconsider. Biden also emphasized the need for safe storage laws and personal liability for not securing firearms. Although gun rights advocates, backed by the powerful gun lobby, resist such measures, Biden argued that the right to bear arms should not override public safety.",

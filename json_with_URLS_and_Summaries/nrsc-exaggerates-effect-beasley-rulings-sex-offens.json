        "summary": "The ad accusing Cheri Beasley of freeing a child porn offender was pulled from North Carolina TV stations after being deemed inaccurate. The Republican National Committee's ad claimed Beasley voted to set the offender free, referencing a 2019 North Carolina Supreme Court decision. Beasley, as Chief Justice, was part of a majority that upheld a lower court's ruling that evidence was obtained through an illegal search, violating the Fourth Amendment. Despite the ruling, the defendant was still incarcerated as of 2020. Stations removed the ad, citing errors in its claims, while Republicans defended its accuracy, pointing to records indicating the defendant's convictions were vacated. Beasley's campaign countered, stating Republicans were spreading falsehoods",
        "snippet": "An ad produced by supporters of Cheri Beasleys opponent, Representative Ted Budd, described the case of a child porn offender and accused her of having voted to set him free in 2019."

        "summary": "Democrat Cheri Beasley lost the North Carolina U.S. Senate race to Republican Ted Budd, who is set to replace retiring Senator Richard Burr. Despite Beasley's financial advantage in the campaign's final weeks, conservative groups outweighed Democratic spending. Both candidates campaigned extensively across North Carolina leading up to the election, which included debates where they discussed various key policies like the economy and abortion. Political observers noted Budd's win as being bolstered by disciplined campaigning and the support of high-profile Republicans. Polls showed the race was tight until the end, highlighting significant issues such as alleged tax hike plans and policing fund votes by each candidate, which were subjects of fact-checking. Despite Beasley's higher raise of campaign funds, outside conservative spending significantly favored Ted Budd, which contributed to the Republican hold on the Senate seat.",

        "summary": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) aired an attack ad against U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasley, alleging she set a child pornography offender free and dismissed serious charges against other predators. However, several North Carolina TV stations, including Cox Media Group, pulled the ad after it was found to contain false claims. One such falsehood was the assertion that Beasley freed a child pornography offender, James Howard Terrell. The ad misrepresented her involvement in his case, where she voted to remand it due to an unlawful search of evidence, but did not release Terrell. Additionally, the ad inaccurately accused Beasley of dismissing cases involving a sexual predator and a child molester. Beasley had remanded cases to lower courts based on legal technicalities, such as improper jury instructions or failure to include the victim’s name in an indictment, but did not dismiss convictions. Beasley’s campaign defended her record, emphasizing her work with law enforcement to hold violent offenders accountable. The NRSC stood by the ad, warning that Cox’s decision would affect future media purchases.",
        "snippet": "The ad also accuses Beasley of tossing the conviction of an online predator and throwing out the indictment of a sexual predator who assaulted a 7-year-old girl."

        "summary": "A GOP ad attacking Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasley was rated mostly false by fact-checkers. The ad claimed Beasley, a former state Supreme Court Chief Justice, overturned a conviction involving a man soliciting sex with a boy online, which was misleading as it was a police sting operation with no boy involved, and the conviction remained on the man's record. The ad also claimed she voted to free a child porn offender, relating to a privacy violation in searching computer files, but the defendant remained in prison. The ad exaggerated the effects of these rulings, prompting multiple TV stations to pull it due to its misleading content.",

        "summary": "Cheri Beasley, Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate from North Carolina, has focused her campaign on highlighting her judicial record. Though she promotes this as a key strength, it may also be a vulnerability in the upcoming General Election. Critics argue that her judicial decisions often diverged from majority opinions, notably wanting to release a convicted murderer due to early release credits, affirm a reversed verdict for a felon, and dissent from upholding a conviction of a sex offender citing First Amendment rights. With increasing voter concerns about crime, it is suggested that Beasley's judicial record requires careful examination.",
        "snippet": "However, what Beasley fails to mention is the various cases where she bucked the majority opinion of the court and wanted to give get out of jail free cards to a convicted murderer, a convicted felon, and a sex offender. In State v. Bowden, Beasley wanted to set a man free who was convicted of two counts of first degree murder because of ..."

        "summary": "An ad attacking Cheri Beasley, a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate and former North Carolina Chief Justice, was fact-checked and found to contain claims that are only half-true. The ad claimed Beasley vacated the death sentence of a man who shot a 17-year-old. This claim is technically true, but lacks context: the death sentence was altered due to the Racial Justice Act, and Beasley was part of a decision that maintaining a life sentence was not double jeopardy. The ad also stated Beasley threw out the indictment of a man convicted of assaulting a 7-year-old. While the indictment was indeed dismissed, the ruling was about procedural compliance with state law rather than the merits of the case. The fact-check concluded that the ad was partially accurate but omitted critical details.",

        "summary": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has modified an attack ad against North Carolina Senate candidate Cheri Beasley after Cox Media Group claimed it included false information. The ad falsely stated that Beasley allowed a child sex offender to go free, referencing a 2019 case involving James Terrell, who was accused of possessing child pornography. Beasley, along with the majority of the North Carolina Supreme Court, upheld a ruling regarding an unconstitutional search of Terrell’s thumb drive. The original ad implied that Beasley released Terrell, but records show he remained in prison until December 2021, and his release was due to a court order. Following complaints from Cox, several North Carolina stations pulled the ad. Cox later clarified that it had not formally decided to pull the ad and claimed the initial email suggesting so was a miscommunication. In response, NRSC reworded the ad to state that Beasley 'sided with him... not the police', in an attempt to air it again. The controversy also involved Marc Elias, a Democrat who helped send the cease-and-desist letters to the stations. Beasley’s campaign condemned the ad as a lie, while NRSC continued to defend it, emphasizing Beasley’s record on crime and child protection.",
        "snippet": "Terrell remained in prison from 2016 until Dec. 23, 2021, when he was released by court order, according to court documents and records from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety."

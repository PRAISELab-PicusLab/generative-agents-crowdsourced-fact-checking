        "summary": "Florida rents are high, but U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist exaggerated when comparing them to New York City's housing market. While the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area had a median rent greater than New York City's in March 2022, other Florida cities remained less expensive. Most cities in Florida, such as Tampa and Orlando, are still more affordable than New York City. However, from the perspective of rental and ownership premiums, several Florida cities are indeed more overpriced than New York City. A study revealed that the top five most overvalued rental markets in the U.S. were all in Florida, while New York City was among the least overpriced markets. Therefore, Crist's claim is partially accurate; Miami-Fort Lauderdale area rents were higher than New York's median rent, but overall Florida's rents generally lag behind. The increased premium in Florida markets suggests a significant overvaluation relative to New York City's. PolitiFact rated Cristâ€™s claim as Half True.",

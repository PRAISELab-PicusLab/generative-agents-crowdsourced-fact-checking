        "summary": "Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s claim of creating 25,000 auto jobs in Michigan is based on announcements rather than actual employment, according to a fact-check by the Detroit Free Press. Publicly available data does not support her claim, showing instead a loss of 1,600 to 3,000 auto jobs since January 2019. Whitmer’s team clarified that their estimate reflects jobs announced in expansions, not jobs currently filled. Although numerous companies have pledged to create over 25,000 jobs with state incentives, many jobs, including those from GM, have yet to be realized. Consequently, the claim is rated as “Mostly False.” The Mackinac Center for Public Policy suggests that using job announcements as a measure is misleading, as it fails to consider jobs lost in the sector.",
        "snippet": "But for the watchdog media, you might believe it when Whitmer says Michigan has created 25,000 auto jobs since January 2019. Hendrickson rates Whitmers claim Mostly False, as thousands of those jobs havent been created yet, and employment data shows those added havent made up for job losses in Michigans auto industry."

        "summary": "'Since I took office, Michigan has added more than 25,000 auto jobs,' claimed Governor Gretchen Whitmer. However, while this figure refers to jobs that automakers and suppliers have promised to create as part of state agreements, it does not reflect actual job growth. Employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a decline of 3,390 jobs in Michigan's transportation equipment manufacturing sector from January 2019 to May 2022, with the auto industry only recovering to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, many of the jobs Whitmer cites have not yet materialized, and economic uncertainty raises questions about whether these promised jobs will be fully realized. Despite Whitmer's optimism, the claim overlooks critical details, leading to the rating of 'Mostly False.'",
        "snippet": "Hershbein said. Using that measure, Whitmer's claim that Michigan has added more than 25,000 new auto jobs isn't borne out by employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of auto jobs in Michigan as of May 2022  the most recently available data  was slightly lower than it was in January 2019 when Whitmer took office."

        "summary": "'Since I took office, Michigan has added more than 25,000 auto jobs', claimed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer, has been fact-checked and found to be inaccurate. An analysis by Michigan Capitol Confidential using Bureau of Labor Statistics data revealed that Michigan had actually lost 1,600 auto jobs between January 2019 and April 2022, rather than gaining 25,000. Several other outlets, including The Washington Free Beacon and the Detroit Free Press, also disputed Whitmer's statement. Whitmer's aide later clarified that the figure was based on job announcements, not actual jobs created, describing it as a 'conservative estimate.' Whitmer modified her claim to state that 25,000 'projected' jobs had been announced, acknowledging that the number was not based on actual job data.",
        "snippet": "After Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claimed Michigan has created 25,000 auto jobs during her tenure, Michigan Capitol Confidential found the real numbers to be quite a bit different. ... Its good Whitmer has dropped the fiction that Michigan has 25,000 more auto jobs than it had when she took office. What she had said simply wasnt true."

        "title": "Ketanji Brown Jackson, Abortion & Roe v. Wade Explored",
        "summary": "Ketanji Brown Jackson, nominated by President Joe Biden for the U.S. Supreme Court, has not publicly commented on her stance regarding Roe v. Wade during her confirmation hearings, adhering to the principle that judges should not critique governing laws. She was involved in a friend-of-the-court brief supporting abortion rights through buffer zones around abortion clinics but maintains she is bound by current Supreme Court precedent. Planned Parenthood has expressed support for her nomination, while pro-life groups oppose it, expressing concerns about her alignment with pro-abortion stances. Additionally, Jackson served on the board of a Christian school advocating for the sanctity of life.",

        "title": "AP FACT CHECK: Senators misrepresent Jackson on abortion",
        "summary": "Republican senators misrepresented Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson's views on abortion during her confirmation hearing. Senator Marsha Blackburn incorrectly suggested Jackson called all anti-abortion women 'hostile, noisy' in a legal brief she co-signed, which referred specifically to the dynamics of protestors at abortion clinics, not pro-life women generally. Senator Thom Tillis acknowledged the context of the brief but raised concerns about Jackson’s stance on free speech. Additionally, Senator Ted Cruz criticized Jackson's reluctance to define 'woman' during the hearings, a question typically not asked of Supreme Court nominees. Finally, Blackburn misstated Jackson’s ruling on inmate releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Jackson had noted the health risks but ruled against the release of a particular inmate, with broader release decisions falling outside her judicial remit.",
        "snippet": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Republican senators painted Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson as hostile to anti-abortion views, twisting words from a legal brief she co-signed years ago as evidence she would rule broadly against abortion opponents. Thats a misrepresentation. A look at some of the statements during three days of confirmation ..."

        "title": "Factcheck: Yes, Ketanji Brown Jackson Would Uphold Roe v. Wade and ...",
        "summary": "Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, despite not making explicit statements about abortion during her confirmation hearings, is generally believed to support Roe v. Wade and abortion on demand, especially by both sides of the abortion debate. While Politifact labeled U.S. Rep. Bob Good's claim that Jackson supports 'abortion on demand up to birth' as false, due to her lack of rulings or statements on related cases, other factors suggest her support. Jackson's past involvement includes clerking for Justice Breyer, who opposed a ban on partial-birth abortions, and representing clients like NARAL in cases affecting pro-life protesters. Politifact argues Roe v. Wade doesn't allow abortions up to birth but does not entirely restrict states from deciding otherwise. Jackson has not ruled on abortion cases but has supported pro-abortion stances through her legal career, gaining the backing of groups like NARAL Pro-Choice America. President Biden's promise to nominate a justice favorable to abortion adds to the assumptions about her stance.",
        "snippet": "Wade doesnt establish unlimited abortion on demand up to birth. According to its fact check: The landmark Roe v. Wade court ruling doesnt grant the right to an abortion on demand up to the moment of birth. It basically protects the right until a fetus can survive outside the womb, often at the 23rd or 24th week of pregnancy."

        "summary": "During the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson, Republican senators misrepresented her stance on abortion. They cited her past legal brief as evidence of hostility towards anti-abortion views, which was misleading. The brief, co-signed by Jackson years ago, described a situation concerning a Massachusetts law establishing a buffer zone around clinics to protect all women from protesters, not specifically targeting pro-life women. Senator Marsha Blackburn took a quote from the brief out of context, suggesting it represented Jackson's views, while Senator Thom Tillis acknowledged she might not have authored the contentious language. Additionally, Senator Ted Cruz criticized Jackson for not defining what a woman is, aiming to score political points on transgender issues, though such a question is rare for Supreme Court nominees.",

        "summary": "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has not directly ruled on abortion but has supported pro-choice, Roe-affirming positions in related cases. She believes Roe v. Wade is settled law and would treat any ruling that overturns it as any other precedent. While she was not part of the current Supreme Court case challenging abortion rights, her stance and judicial approach suggest she would align with pro-choice views in future abortion-related cases. During her confirmation hearings, she emphasized that personal beliefs, such as when life begins, would not influence her judicial decisions. Jackson's nomination has been supported by Planned Parenthood, reflecting her commitment to reproductive rights.",

        "summary": "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has not directly ruled on abortion but is likely pro-choice, as indicated by her previous involvement in related cases and support from Planned Parenthood. During her Senate confirmation hearings, Jackson described Roe v. Wade as 'settled law,' aligning with a precedent-affirming stance. Although questioned about personal beliefs, she emphasized that these would not influence her judicial decisions. Jackson, appointed by President Biden, will impact future abortion-related cases, despite not being involved in a current Supreme Court case to possibly overturn Roe v. Wade. Her presence suggests a continued protection of reproductive rights.",

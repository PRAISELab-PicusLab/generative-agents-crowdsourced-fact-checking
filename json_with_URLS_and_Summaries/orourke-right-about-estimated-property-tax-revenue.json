        "title": "House Republicans: Cut Texas Sales Tax Rate, Not Property Taxes",
        "summary": "House Republicans in Texas propose a plan to lower the state's sales tax rate from 6.25% to 5.95%, marking the first such reduction in Texas history. This plan diverges from Governor Greg Abbott's preference for homeowner tax relief. The proposed reduction is presented as a fulfillment of conservatives' promises for substantial tax cuts but would result in over $2 billion in lost revenue for the state. Democrats argue that these funds could be better spent on infrastructure projects like roads or on expanding prekindergarten programs. This proposal highlights a growing divide with the Senate, which favors cuts to property taxes instead.",

        "title": "Has Texas seen a $20-billion increase in property taxes under Abbott?",
        "summary": "Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke claimed that under Governor Greg Abbott, Texas saw a $20 billion increase in property taxes. While O'Rourke's figure is supported by data from the Texas comptroller and the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which shows an increase in collected property taxes from $52.2 billion in 2015 to $73 billion in 2021, property tax rates are set locally, not by the state or the governor. State policies can indirectly influence property taxes, but the governor's role is limited. The Texas Taxpayers and Research Association noted that the state's reforms have slowed the increase in property taxes. Though property values (and, consequently, taxes) rose, state interventions, like increased tax exemptions, affect overall tax burdens. O'Rourke's statement was rated as 'Mostly True' due to the indirect nature of the governor's influence on property taxes.",

The data supports this claim, with property taxes increasing from about $50 billion in 2015 to over $70 billion in 2021. However, while the figure is accurate, property taxes are set locally, not by the state government. State policies can indirectly influence property tax levels, but Abbott's role in directly setting these taxes is limited. Thus, the claim is mostly true, but the state's direct responsibility for the increase is minimal.",

        "summary": "Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke claimed that under Governor Greg Abbott, property taxes in Texas have increased by $20 billion. O'Rourke's statement was part of a broader critique of Abbott, attributing him as a major contributor to inflation in Texas. He also cited rising electricity bills, border traffic delays due to inspections ordered by Abbott, and increased internet and phone costs for rural Texans. These points were used to argue that Abbott is amplifying consumer prices in Texas, which are already rising nationwide. The specific claim regarding the $20 billion increase in property taxes was investigated by PolitiFact Texas.",
        "snippet": "ORourke released an Instagram video on April 23 with the caption, Greg Abbott is the single greatest driver of inflation in the state of Texas. TV news clips were stitched together with clips of ORourke speaking. In one clip in the montage, ORourke says, Under Greg Abbott, property taxes have gone up $20 billion."

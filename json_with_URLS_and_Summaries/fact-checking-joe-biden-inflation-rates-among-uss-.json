        "summary": "White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded to a question about President Biden's claim that US inflation is lower compared to other countries. While Biden stated that Americans are better off, US inflation in May was 8.6%, higher than the Eurozone's 8.1%, South Korea's 5.4%, and lesser than Australia and Canada in recent measures. Jean-Pierre emphasized that inflation is a global issue, exacerbated by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Discussing US energy policy, she explained that while Biden urges more oil refining, drilling more is unnecessary; existing oil resources need refining to lower prices. Biden continues to support clean energy proposals despite previously aiming to reduce fossil fuel reliance.",

        "summary": "President Joe Biden claimed that inflation is higher in other major industrial countries when compared to the United States. This assertion was made during an interview with the Associated Press amid discussions on the high levels of inflation in the U.S. Biden argued that global conditions, such as high oil prices and economic disruptions from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, are responsible rather than his policies. However, a fact-check reveals that his statement can be interpreted in two ways: comparing current inflation rates of other nations to the U.S., or comparing the current inflation to historical norms within those countries. If Biden meant that other advanced economies have higher inflation rates than the U.S. currently, he is incorrect, as data show that a significant number of countries, including most G-7 nations, have lower inflation rates than the U.S. If his intent was to suggest that these countries are experiencing inflation levels higher than their pre-pandemic rates, then he would be correct. Ultimately, while U.S. policies may have stimulated the economy, contributing to faster economic growth, they have also led to higher inflation compared to international peers. The claim is rated as Half True by PolitiFact.",

        "summary": "Inflation in the U.S. has generally been rising during Joe Biden's presidency, with rates increasing from 1.4% in January 2021 to 8.3% in April 2022, and peaking at 8.5% in March 2022, the highest in over 40 years. While House Republicans claim inflation has increased every month of Biden's tenure, this is not entirely accurate. Inflation rates were roughly unchanged from June to September 2021, and there was a slight slowdown in April 2022. Various factors, including the Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 pandemic effects, and fiscal policies, have contributed to these inflation increases. The Biden administration has faced criticism over handling inflation, with approval ratings declining. Efforts to curb inflation, discussed in a White House meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman and Treasury Secretary, are ongoing. Overall, although inflation has risen significantly, the claim that it has increased every single month of Biden's presidency is mostly accurate, given the general upward trend.",

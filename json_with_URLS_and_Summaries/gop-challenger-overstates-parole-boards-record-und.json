        "summary": "Rob Astorino, a Republican candidate for governor of New York, claimed that 20 people convicted of killing police officers were released on parole in the last two years under Governor Kathy Hochul. However, the provided evidence shows that only six individuals were released in that timeframe, with three released during Hochul’s governorship. A police union's comprehensive list confirmed 15 such releases in the last two years, and five since Hochul took office. Astorino's statement at the debate misrepresented the timeframe and overestimated parole releases linked to police officer deaths, according to fact-checkers, who rated the claim as false.",
        "snippet": "'We've got a parole board right now that has released 20 cop killers in the last two years under Hochul. They should all be fired' Astorino said during a June 13 GOP primary debate."

        "summary": "Media Bias Fact Check, known for curating fact checks, provides updates on various claims and their veracity as of June 28, 2022. A claim by GOP challenger Rob Astorino, stating that New York's parole board released 20 cop killers in the last two years under Governor Hochul, was rated false by Politifact, which found only five such releases. OccupyDemocrats' statement claiming Ron DeSantis is losing to Charlie Crist was rated mostly false by Newsweek, as recent polls are within the margin of error and lack reliability. Joe Biden’s claim regarding Roe v. Wade overturning making the U.S. an abortion rights outlier was considered mostly true. False claims via social media linking the Bieber couple's medical conditions to COVID-19 vaccination were refuted by FactCheck.org. Other debunked claims include assertions on the January 6 Capitol riot and the UK asylum seeker flight by European court rulings.",

        "summary": "New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed the Less Is More Act, a parole reform bill, leading to the immediate release of 191 state prison inmates who were incarcerated for technical parole violations. This legislation addresses practices like returning individuals to prison for minor infractions such as missing curfews or failing drug tests. Hochul, in collaboration with New York City officials, is also working to alleviate poor conditions at Riker’s Island by transferring inmates to safer state facilities. The reforms, effective March 2022, aim to prevent disproportionate impacts on Black and Latinx communities. The move, supported by progressives, has been criticized by the state’s Republican Party for allegedly compromising public safety.",

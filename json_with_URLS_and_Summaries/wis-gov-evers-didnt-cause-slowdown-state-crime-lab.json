        "summary": "'On Gov. Tony Evers' watch, the efficiency of the state crime lab has plummeted', said the Republican Party of Wisconsin. As crime spikes in Milwaukee, including a recent shooting of a sheriff’s deputy and a record number of homicides in 2021, Evers has been criticized for his lack of action. Despite a press conference on violence prevention in October 2021, which was interrupted by gunfire, he has remained silent on the issue of rising crime. Republican officials, including Communications Director Anna Kelly, argue that Evers' approach, which includes vague funding promises, does not constitute an effective public safety strategy.",
        "snippet": "January 26, 2022. [Milwaukee, WI]  Last night, Milwaukee was struck by yet another horrific act of violence after a sheriffs deputy was shot following a traffic stop. Tragically, this is only the most recent event in a two-year crime spike, as the city once again set a record for homicides in 2021. Meanwhile, Tony Evers is missing in action."

        "title": "ICYMI: State Crime Lab Efficiency Plummets Under Josh Kaul",
        "summary": "Under Josh Kaul's leadership, the efficiency of Wisconsin's state crime lab has significantly declined in critical areas such as crime scene report finalization, DNA analysis, and controlled substance case processing. Despite a substantial legislative investment, the lab has handled nearly 30% fewer cases compared to the final year of his predecessor, Brad Schimel. Kaul has faced criticism for making excuses, including blaming inherited backlogs, staff turnover, and the COVID-19 pandemic, but the lab's performance remains worse than under Schimel. Even with fewer cases, Kaul's office has struggled to reduce turnaround times, and his administration's focus on methodology changes has not improved public safety.",
        "snippet": "August 12, 2021. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has failed on public safety, with crime lab delays worse in key areas  like guns and DNA  than those under former Republican AG Brad Schimel. Even though Schimels crime lab was more productive and effective, he was hammered relentlessly by Kaul and the news media."

        "summary": "Under the leadership of Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, the state's crime lab has seen a significant decline in efficiency. Despite a legislative investment to improve the labs, key areas such as crime scene report finalization, DNA analysis, and controlled substance processing have worsened. Even though the lab has fewer cases to handle, it is taking longer to deliver crucial evidence. These delays predate the COVID-19 pandemic, and Kaul's office has struggled with reduced productivity compared to his predecessor, Brad Schimel. Kaul has attributed the problems to various factors, including backlogs, staffing issues, and external circumstances, but his failure to improve turnaround times has been criticized, especially as crime rates rise. Despite claiming a commitment to addressing crime lab inefficiencies, Kaul has not succeeded in improving the lab’s performance.",

        "summary": "' On Evers’ watch, the efficiency of the state crime lab has plummeted' is a claim made by the Wisconsin Republican Party. However, the assertion is not fully supported by the evidence. While some evidence categories, like DNA and toxicology samples, have seen longer processing times under Attorney General Josh Kaul (who oversees the lab, not Gov. Tony Evers), other categories, such as firearms cases, saw faster processing times. Additionally, Evers' role in crime lab operations is limited to budgetary oversight, and although he included funding for additional staff, the Republican-controlled Legislature reduced this funding. Therefore, the claim is mostly inaccurate.",
        "snippet": "The state Republican Party claimed that on Evers watch ... the effi ciency of the state crime lab has plummeted. Though the number of cases referred to the labs has dropped since 2018, the average amount of processing time for some areas, such as DNA samples, toxicology and controlled substances has increased."

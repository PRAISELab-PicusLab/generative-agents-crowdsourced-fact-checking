        "summary": "U.S. Rep. Troy Nehls claimed that in Joe Biden's America, your children are more likely to have access to a crack pipe than a mask-free education. This statement is false. The Biden administration’s Harm Reduction Program Grants fund overdose prevention efforts, including safe smoking kits aimed at reducing disease transmission, but federal officials clarified these kits do not include crack pipes. The program is not directed at children. Furthermore, there is no federal mandate for masks in schools, and states have been rolling back school mask mandates. PolitiFact rated Nehls' claim as Pants on Fire due to its inaccuracy and exaggeration.",

        "summary": "Crack cocaine is a highly addictive stimulant drug, derived from cocaine. It is usually smoked, allowing for rapid onset of effects. The drug was developed in the late 1970s in the US due to an oversupply of cocaine, leading to a price drop. Drug dealers converted cocaine into crack because it was cheaper, easier to manufacture, and increased demand. Crack spread quickly across the US, peaking in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and later proliferated globally. It is widely abused in places like the US, Europe, and Australia. Consumption levels are varied, and the drug is used by people across different demographics. Legal penalties for crack-related offenses are severe, with significant prison sentences for trafficking and possession. Crack cocaine is illegal, unlike cocaine, which has limited medical uses. The drug is dangerous due to its addictive nature and adverse effects on health, relationships, and legal status. Crack addiction causes significant harm, with no benefits at any level of use. The article emphasizes the need for awareness and treatment options for those struggling with addiction.",

        "summary": "Joe Biden has a long history of involvement in drug policy. He acknowledges past mistakes in supporting harsh drug laws in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly regarding the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, which he later worked to rectify. Biden believes addiction should be treated rather than punished, advocating for increasing funding for prevention, treatment, and recovery services. He supports decriminalizing marijuana but not legalizing it federally, allowing states to make their own decisions. Biden has expressed a focus on rehabilitation over incarceration for non-violent drug offenses, creating drug courts to divert offenders from prison to treatment. He aims to shift the criminal justice system from a punitive approach to one focused on rehabilitation. Biden has also been a proponent of social work and psychological support in addressing mental health issues that lead to substance abuse. Despite his advocacy for decriminalization, historically, Biden has been opposed to fully legalizing marijuana and labeled it a gateway drug. Over the years, he has called for a comprehensive approach to drug policy reform, emphasizing evidence-based solutions and fairness in sentencing laws.",

I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem."

        "title": "Fact Check: Biden admin isnt funding crack pipes - CNN",
        "summary": "The Biden administration is not funding the distribution of crack pipes, despite a viral article claiming otherwise. A report from the Washington Free Beacon asserted that a federal grant program for substance abuse assistance, managed by an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), would fund 'safe smoking kits' that include crack pipes. HHS and the White House clarified that there was never a plan to include pipes in these kits. The confusion arose partly due to a misrepresented email exchange and the lack of clarity in what the kits would contain. Some politicians have used this controversy to propose legislation preventing federal funds from being used for such items. The HHS explicitly stated that no federal funds would be used to purchase pipes, which the White House confirmed was consistent with their policy from the start. Efforts like the CRACK Act and the bipartisan Preventing Illicit Paraphernalia for Exchange Systems (PIPES) Act have been introduced to further prohibit the use of federal funds for drug paraphernalia, such as needles or pipes.",

        "summary": "Conservative commentator Candace Owens mocked President Biden during a Fox News segment with Tucker Carlson. She sarcastically criticized Biden's administration, implying it does not care about the health and well-being of Americans, specifically regarding supposed plans to distribute crack pipes—a claim stemming from a report about a $30 million grant program. Owens further lampooned Biden by suggesting absurd ways to stay healthy under his leadership. The backlash to the report prompted Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to clarify that no federal funds would be used for crack pipes in safe smoking kits, emphasizing their commitment to harm reduction strategies and combating drug addiction and trafficking effectively.",
        "snippet": "All you have to do it to be healthy in Joe Bidens America is stay at home, lock your doors, avoid sunlight, mask your children. When you step outside, let it only be to get five vaccines and maybe do a smash and grab crime and then on your way back home, grab a government-sponsored crack pipe."

This initiative is part of a $30 million grant program that will start in May, offering financial support to nonprofits and local governments to make drug use safer for addicts. The grant will include funds for 'smoking kits/supplies,' providing pipes for smoking crack cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and other illicit substances. This program is supervised by the Department of Health and Human Services. The initiative has been met with substantial criticism and skepticism, with some questioning the implications and motivations behind promoting drug use as a means of advancing racial equity.",

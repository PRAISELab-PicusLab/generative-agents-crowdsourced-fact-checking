        "summary": "Curious about Rep. Bennie Thompson's role in the 2004 election objection? While it's true that Thompson was one of 31 Democrats who voted to object to Ohio's electoral votes in 2005, context matters. Unlike the intense, widespread claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, the 2005 objection was largely symbolic. Senator John Kerry had already conceded the 2004 presidential race, and the objection was recognized as a procedural dead end. In contrast, after the 2020 election, Donald Trump never conceded and worked aggressively to overturn the results, culminating in the January 6 Capitol riot. The 2005 vote was a protest, not a genuine attempt to change the outcome. So, while the Republicans' statement is technically accurate, it misses key details. Get the full breakdown and understand the difference in implications between these two pivotal moments in U.S. history. This statement is rated Mostly True.",

        "summary": "Bennie Gordon Thompson, born January 28, 1948, is a Democratic U.S. representative for Mississippi's 2nd congressional district since 1993. Thompson has held numerous positions, including chair of the House Homeland Security Committee (2007–2011 and 2019–2023) and the House January 6th Committee (2021–2023). He is the only Democrat in Mississippi's congressional delegation and represents the state's only majority-black district. Thompson is a liberal member, advocating for homeland security, civil rights, and health care reform. He objected to certifying the 2004 presidential election results in Ohio, believing in alleged irregularities. Thompson co-negotiated the creation of a commission to investigate the January 6 Capitol attack, though it was blocked by Senate Republicans. He is known for his efforts to limit classified documents, reform aviation security, and improve disaster response post-Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Thompson also proposed legislation to strip Secret Service protection from convicted felons after Donald Trump's conviction. He is a member of various caucuses, including the Congressional Black Caucus, and was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Thompson lives with his wife London Johnson and has one daughter and two grandchildren. Bennie Thompson was one of 31 House Democrats who objected to the certification of the 2004 presidential election results in Ohio, which George W. Bush won by over 118,000 votes. The objection was based on alleged irregularities or fraud, though these claims were dismissed after investigation. Democratic nominee John Kerry did not challenge the results. Thompson later defended his vote as a reflection of concerns at the time, stating it was a procedural objection without disruptive actions.",
        "snippet": "Thompson was one of 31 House Democrats to object to the certification of the results of the 2004 presidential election in Ohio. [7] President George W. Bush won Ohio, the state the representatives objected to counting, by 118,457 votes. [8] Democrats claimed the results were tainted by irregularities or fraud. [9]"

        "title": "What Bennie Thompson did on Jan. 6, 2005 | Washington Examiner",
        "summary": "On January 6, 2005, Rep. Bennie Thompson voted against certifying Ohio's electoral votes from the 2004 presidential election, joining 31 House Democrats in a protest challenging the results. This protest was based on allegations and internet rumors about voting irregularities and manipulation of voting machines, which some believed affected the election outcome. The Democrats sought to use the Electoral Count Act to challenge the certification, but ultimately, the challenge was not successful. Thompson's actions in 2005 have drawn parallels to the actions of Republicans in 2021, who similarly objected to the certification of the 2020 election results. Despite this, Thompson is now the chairman of the House Jan. 6 committee investigating the 2021 election challenges led by Trump supporters. This presents an apparent contradiction in Thompson's stance regarding election challenges across different years.",

        "summary": "Media Bias/Fact Check has published several fact checks. Notably, a claim that the DOJ is solely using geotracking to prove January 6 defendants were inside the U.S. Capitol has been rated false, as multiple sources confirm additional methods like camera footage and Wi-Fi data are used. A viral claim regarding Ray Liotta's death being caused by the COVID-19 vaccine received a 'Pants on Fire' rating, indicating it's untrue. Another false claim suggests the USDA predicted a dozen eggs would cost $12, a statement without evidence. Finally, it is mostly true that Bennie Thompson objected to the 2004 Presidential election; he was among Democrats who opposed Ohio's electoral votes in 2005, although the effort was a known dead end as John Kerry had already conceded.",

However, this action did not aim to overturn the election outcome and lacked the necessary support to alter the results.

        "title": "PolitiFact VA: Spanberger goes after meat packer profits | VPM",
        "summary": "Rep. Abigail Spanberger’s statement that the four big meat packers are raking in record profits is accurate. The four major meat-packing corporations—JBS Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill, and Marfrig—reported record profits for their most recent financial periods. JBS saw a 70% profit increase, Tyson a 91% increase, and Cargill a 60% increase over their previous fiscal years, while Marfrig reported its highest-ever annual profit in 2021 despite a drop in early 2022 due to investments. These companies attribute their profits to pandemic-related disruptions, inflation, and supply chain issues, while ranchers face stagnant livestock prices and rising costs. Spanberger’s claim is rated True.",
        "snippet": "JBS had a record net profit of $4.4 billion for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2022  a 70% increase over the previous 12 months. Tyson had a record $4.1 billion net profit for the year ending March 31, 2022  a 91% increase over the previous 12 months."

        "title": "Meat packers' profit margins jumped 300% during pandemic - Reuters",
        "summary": "Four major U.S. meat-processing companies—Tyson Foods, JBS, Marfrig, and Seaboard—have significantly increased profits since the pandemic began, with net profit margins rising over 300% and gross profits jumping 120%, according to White House economic advisers. Despite controlling 55%-85% of the beef, poultry, and pork markets, the companies attributed rising meat prices to increased labor and transportation costs, claims the White House analysis disputed. The firms also announced over $4 billion in dividends and stock buybacks during the pandemic. The analysis noted that rising input costs would typically flatten profit margins, but instead, gross margins rose 50%, and net margins soared. For instance, Tyson raised beef prices by over 35% while selling less meat, achieving record profits. Meat price increases contributed 25% to the rise in food costs for home consumption in November, exacerbating inflation. Critics, including the North American Meat Institute, accused the White House of selectively using data to shift focus from broader inflation issues, such as gas and energy prices. The White House, facing inflation-related criticism, is pushing against alleged anticompetitive practices in the meatpacking industry as part of its response.",

        "title": "Big four meatpackers deny price fixing amid record profits",
        "summary": "The CEOs of the leading four meatpacking companies—Cargill, JBS USA, Tyson Foods, and National Beef Packing—denied allegations of price-fixing during a House Agriculture Committee hearing, despite seeing record profits amidst high meat prices. They attributed their profit margins to inflationary trends caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and increased demand. However, these companies have faced legal settlements over price inflation accusations, such as Tyson’s $221.5 million and JBS's $52.5 million settlements. Critics argue that their market power leads to noncompetitive pricing harmful to ranchers, who are struggling despite soaring beef prices. Lawmakers called for stronger enforcement of antitrust laws, with some questioning the DOJ's progress on an antitrust investigation into the meatpackers' actions.",

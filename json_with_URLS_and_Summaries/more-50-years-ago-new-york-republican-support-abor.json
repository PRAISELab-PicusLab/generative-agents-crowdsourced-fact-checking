        "summary": "Thirteen Catholic U.S. senators voted in favor of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a pro-abortion bill that failed to pass the Senate. This bill aimed to bypass state pro-life laws and allow unrestricted abortions, conflicting with Catholic teachings that condemn abortion. The senators include Maria Cantwell, Bob Casey, and others. Church leaders and pro-life advocates criticized these Catholic lawmakers for opposing church doctrine. Archbishop William Lori and Cardinal Timothy Dolan opposed the bill, emphasizing the church’s stance on the protection of unborn life. The bill was part of an effort by Democrats to reinforce abortion rights amidst concerns that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade. The act did not receive enough support to overcome a filibuster, with the final vote showing 46 for and 48 against, mostly along party lines. The church continues to advocate for pro-life policies, urging lawmakers, especially Catholics, to uphold the sanctity of life from conception.",

        "summary": "New York State Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins is advocating for a bill to establish a liberal state abortion law by codifying Roe v. Wade. She has maneuvered to force the Republican-controlled state Senate to consider a bill that updates the current state abortion law. If passed, it would allow abortions after 24 weeks based on fetal viability and shift abortion regulations from the criminal to the health code, removing penalties for post-24-week abortions. The bill seeks to address outdated laws regarding contraception access, such as removing age restrictions and vendor limitations. Stewart-Cousins has previously proposed this bill and faces challenges due to the Republican majority in the Senate. However, she has support from 18 Democratic senators and four dissenting Democrats, though some opposition remains. Mobilizing support from past bipartisan efforts, Stewart-Cousins aims to ensure New York's laws remain liberal in the face of national discussions on reproductive rights.",
        "snippet": "Stewart-Cousins said she is undeterred, and notes that a bipartisan legislature first legalized abortion in New York in 1970. During that vote, then-Majority Leader Earl Brydges (R-Wilson), a staunch abortion opponent, placed the bill in front of the Republican Senate expecting a defeat, when several GOP senators voted in favor."

        "title": "ABORTION REFORM APPROVED, 31-26, BY STATE SENATE",
        "summary": "The New York State Senate voted 31-26 on March 18 to replace the state's restrictive 19th-century abortion law with one of the most liberal measures in the country. The bill allows a pregnant woman and her doctor to decide on abortion, without time limits, residency requirements, or restrictions on the number of abortions. It now moves to the Assembly, where reformers are hopeful. Governor Rockefeller is expected to sign the bill if passed. The new law would repeal an 87-year-old statute, allowing abortion when committed by a licensed physician, removing the requirement that it be necessary to save the mother's life. The debate was intense and emotional, with personal testimonies from senators like D. Clinton Dominick, who expressed support for the bill, citing the need for women to make their own decisions. Opponents, including Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges, expressed moral and religious objections. Despite opposition, including from Roman Catholics in the Senate, the bill passed, reflecting growing public pressure for abortion reform.",

        "summary": "Abortion is legal in New York, with post-24th week procedures allowed if a woman's life or health is at risk. The Reproductive Health Act of 2019 emphasizes reproductive health as crucial for a woman's health and equality. Historically, abortion was criminalized in 1827 but began to see reform, notably in 1970 when elective abortions up to 24 weeks were legalized under Governor Nelson Rockefeller, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature. The 2019 Act repealed restrictions on third-trimester abortions and expanded who could perform them to include qualified health practitioners. Legislatively, New York's laws evolved to prioritize health and personal liberty. New York once had many illegal abortion deaths, but legalization in 1970 lessened these, making the state a destination for women seeking legal abortions. Despite a decline in the number of abortion clinics from 302 in 1982 to 95 in 2014, statistics in recent years show New York as a state with a high number of abortions performed. The state's policies have faced numerous protests and legal challenges, both in support of and against abortion rights. Notable cases include Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, addressing protestor restrictions. Abortion-related activities in New York have been influenced by religious figures and protests, with ongoing tensions between abortion rights and anti-abortion groups, sometimes resulting in violence.",
        "snippet": "On April 10, 1970, the New York Senate passed a law decriminalizing abortion in most cases. [14] Republican Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller signed the bill into law the next day. [15] At the time, New York State was a Republican 'trifecta' meaning both chambers of the legislature and the governorship were Republican-controlled. [14]"

        "summary": "In 1970, New York State legalized abortion, becoming the second state to do so after Hawaii. This law, which was more liberal and did not have a residency requirement, was passed through unexpected votes in the state Senate, including support from 12 Republican senators. The bill was initially opposed by the Senate majority leader, Earl W. Brydges, but due to strategic errors, including the church's late mobilization and underestimation of the bill's support, it passed with a 31-26 vote. It was later approved by the Assembly and signed into law by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. This landmark decision came three years before the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling.",

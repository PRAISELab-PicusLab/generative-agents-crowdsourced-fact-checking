Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is quoted, emphasizing that Hillary's ongoing scandals are a distraction from core political issues, and might lead to voter rejection. This is set against a backdrop of urging political engagement, such as actions against non-citizen voting and preventing a federal digital currency.",

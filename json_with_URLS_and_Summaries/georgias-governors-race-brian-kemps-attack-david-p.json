Key claims include: Operation Ukraine's baby formula shipments are not the cause of U.S. shortages—issues stem from supply chain problems, recalls, and plant closures. Newsmax falsely claims abortion increases risks of breast cancer and mental illness; scientific studies do not support this. Claims about Bill Gates and synthetic soy breast milk are unrelated to the baby formula shortage. A claim that Plan B pills are in pregnancy tests is false; the tablets are desiccants. Brian Kemp's claim about David Perdue's votes contributing to inflation is mostly false, as debt increases were from bipartisan votes. A Philippine claim about airport privileges for government officials is false.",

It mentions that House Democrats are pushing for a government package exceeding the current $3 trillion proposal, reminiscent of the Sunrise Movement's vision for $1 trillion annually over a decade. The piece argues that Democrats disguise such spending as 'job-creation bills' or 'economic packages' but it is essentially welfare, with programs like expanded child tax credits labeled 'temporary' though likely to be extended. Republicans are expected to oppose these proposals, having already opposed a $2 trillion package, criticized for including diverse welfare benefits beyond pandemic relief.",

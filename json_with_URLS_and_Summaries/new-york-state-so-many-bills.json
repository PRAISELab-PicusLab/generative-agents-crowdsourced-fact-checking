        "summary": "Governor Kathy Hochul released her first gubernatorial campaign ad ahead of the New York Democratic primary, following the resignation of her indicted lieutenant governor, Brian Benjamin. The ad, titled “Hard Work,” highlights Hochul’s efforts in reducing gun violence, cutting middle-class state income taxes, and her dedication to governance, having passed over 400 new bills. Benjamin resigned after being indicted in a bribery scheme involving illegal campaign donations. The ad campaign includes digital ads and a substantial broadcast TV ad purchase. Hochul faces a primary against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, with polls showing her leading. If successful in the primary, she will likely face GOP front-runner Rep. Lee Zeldin in the general election.",

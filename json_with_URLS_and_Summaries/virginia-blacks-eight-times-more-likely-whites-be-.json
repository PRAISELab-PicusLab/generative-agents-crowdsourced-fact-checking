        "summary": "A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on April 24, 2018, reveals that firearm homicides are significantly higher among black men compared to white men in the United States, with the disparity being particularly pronounced in certain rust belt states. The researchers, led by Corinne A. Riddell, Ph.D., from McGill University, used the CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database to compare rates of firearm and non-firearm homicides and suicides among black and white non-Hispanic men from 2008 to 2016. The study found that black men experienced an additional 9 to 57 firearm homicides per 100,000 annually compared to white men, especially in Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Conversely, white men had higher rates of firearm suicides, with variations across states, including the largest differences in southern and western states. The study highlights the need for policy interventions to address homicide and suicide rates and their racial disparities.",

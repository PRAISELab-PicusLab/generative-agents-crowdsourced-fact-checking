        "summary": "'Top Democrats Want Tom Suozzi Out of Governor’s Race. He’s Still Running.' Representative Tom Suozzi is running for New York Governor, despite significant opposition from within his own party. Prominent Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries, Eliot Spitzer, and Hillary Clinton, have urged him to reconsider, citing his lack of a clear path to victory and advising him to focus on maintaining his House seat instead. Suozzi, a centrist from Long Island, has continued his campaign, challenging Governor Kathy Hochul, who holds a strong lead in the race. Despite the odds, Suozzi is pushing forward, aiming to attract moderate voters, particularly by focusing on crime reduction and tax cuts.",

        "title": "Borrello Says Hochul Would Be 'Capable' In Interim Governor Role",
        "summary": "State Senator George Borrello stated that if New York Governor Andrew Cuomo were to resign or be removed, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul would be 'capable' in the role of interim governor. Borrello welcomed this potential change, describing Hochul as 'genuinely caring and concerned.' He criticized Cuomo’s leadership style, saying it involved rule through fear and intimidation. Borrello also introduced a bill to prohibit elected officials from publishing books about their public service while still in office, inspired by Cuomo's memoir on his administration’s COVID-19 response, which Borrello criticized as unethical for profiting from official duties. The bill was submitted to the Senate Ethics and Internal Governance Committee.",
        "snippet": "Borrello explains that Hochul, who also previously served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, would be a capable, interim governor. I think she is a genuinely caring and concerned person, Borrello said. The Governor set the bar very low as far as being able to work with him."

        "summary": "New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her intention to run for governor in the state's 2022 election following her succession of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is resigning amid sexual harassment allegations. Hochul is set to complete the remaining 15 months of Cuomo's term. She has amassed a campaign fund of approximately $1.7 million, offering her a substantial advantage in the upcoming race. Hochul vowed to avoid the 'toxic' workplace environment of her predecessor and stated that any implicated Cuomo staff would not remain in her administration. Other potential Democratic candidates include State Attorney General Letitia James and New York State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi. Several Republicans, such as U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin and Andrew Giuliani, have also expressed intentions to run. Despite his resignation, Cuomo could still seek reelection if not impeached and convicted, with over $18 million in campaign funds available.",

        "summary": "Kathy Hochul is the 57th governor of New York, assuming office on August 24, 2021, after the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. She is the first female governor of New York and the first governor from Upstate New York since 1922. Hochul began her political career serving on the Hamburg Town Board, eventually becoming Erie County Clerk. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2011, representing New York's 26th district until 2013. Hochul was Cuomo's running mate in 2014, becoming lieutenant governor. As governor, she has secured taxpayer funding for a new Buffalo Bills stadium, halted a congestion pricing plan, and navigated controversies, including her husband's role at Delaware North. Hochul plans to run for reelection in 2026.Kathy Hochul's political views reflect her pragmatic stance on several key issues: TRADE: Hochul opposed free trade agreements like NAFTA, citing negative effects on U.S. wages, benefits, and job loss, particularly in her home state of New York. She also expressed opposition to new free trade deals during her congressional campaign. ENERGY: She supported offering incentives for the development of alternative energy and opposed cuts to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to protect consumers from oil market speculation.FISCAL ISSUES: Hochul advocated for raising taxes on high earners and opposed plans to turn Medicare into a voucher system, emphasizing cost-saving measures like eliminating waste and bulk purchasing of prescription drugs.HEALTH CARE: She supported the Affordable Care Act and opposed efforts to repeal it. Hochul is also pro-choice and criticized the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.IMMIGRATION: In 2023, she called for expediting work permits for migrants in New York to address both a humanitarian crisis and workforce shortage. Regarding the statement 'Hochul is an interim Governor,' this is 'incorrect'. Kathy Hochul became the 57th Governor of New York on August 24, 2021, following Andrew Cuomo's resignation. She is not an interim governor but a duly elected governor, having served as lieutenant governor before her appointment.",

        "summary": "Tom Suozzi, a New York Congressman, is running for governor despite polling at just 6% among Democrats, tying for last place in the primary race. His campaign faces strong opposition from establishment Democrats, including Kathy Hochul, the current governor, who has substantial support, funding, and backing from unions. Suozzi plans to focus on building a specific coalition, appealing to voters outside Long Island, and emphasizing his executive experience over Hochul’s leadership. His platform targets crime reduction, lower taxes, and revisiting bail reform laws, aiming to present a more balanced approach compared to Hochul's more liberal stance. Although Kathy Hochul assumed the governorship after Andrew Cuomo's resignation, she is no longer considered an 'interim governor.' She officially became the Governor of New York in August 2021 and is running for election in 2022 to secure the position. Therefore, she holds the office of governor, not as an interim, but as the sitting governor.",

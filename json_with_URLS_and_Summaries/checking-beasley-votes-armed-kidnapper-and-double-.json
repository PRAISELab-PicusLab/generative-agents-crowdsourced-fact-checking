        "summary": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee claims that Cheri Beasley voted to reverse the conviction of an armed kidnapper and release a double murderer early. This claim is Mostly True, according to Politifact. The ad references two cases: State v. Bobby E. Bowden (2014), where Beasley dissented from the majority ruling denying Bowden good behavior credits to move up his release date, and State v. Ramar Dion Benjamin Crump (2020), where Beasley joined the majority ruling that a trial court erred by blocking the defense from questioning jurors about potential racial biases. While the rulings involved technical legal issues rather than direct decisions to release or reverse convictions, the summary of Beasley’s votes aligns with the claim's framing.",
        "snippet": "MOSTLY TRUE: Claim by the National Republican Senatorial Committee: Cheri Beasley voted to reverse the conviction of an armed kidnapper, release a double murderer early. Politifact rating: Mostly True (The ad refers to the State v. Bobby E. Bowden and State v.

        "summary": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee released ads claiming that Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice on the North Carolina Supreme Court, voted to reverse the conviction of an armed kidnapper and to release a double murderer early. In the case of the armed kidnapper, Beasley agreed with a court decision for a retrial due to potential racial bias in jury selection procedures. Regarding the double murderer, Beasley dissented in a case where the majority ruled against using accumulated credits for good behavior towards early release; he had already served over 30 years. The ads are labeled as 'mostly true', but are criticized for omitting context surrounding the legal reasoning behind Beasley's votes.",

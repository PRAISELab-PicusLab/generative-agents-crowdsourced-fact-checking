        "title": "Congress Cant Codify Roe v. Wade - WSJ",
        "summary": "The Constitution gives Congress no authority to overrule state abortion restrictions. While President Biden urged the Senate to abolish the filibuster to ‘codify Roe v. Wade,’ the real obstacle is constitutional, not just the 60-vote requirement. The Constitution does not address abortion directly, as confirmed by the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Furthermore, the Women’s Health Protection Act, which passed the House, lacks a clear constitutional source of authority, unlike earlier versions that referenced Section 5 of the 14th Amendment and the Commerce Clause in Article I",

        "title": "Kelda Roys: If Roe v. Wade is overturned, I would pardon anyone charged ...",
        "summary": "Kelda Roys, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, has stated that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, she would pardon anyone charged under Wisconsin's criminal abortion ban. She emphasized the importance of electing someone with a strong stance on abortion rights, especially with the potential changes in the U.S. Supreme Court. Wisconsin's abortion ban, in effect since 1849 but unenforceable due to Roe v. Wade, makes it a felony for anyone, except the mother, to perform an abortion. Roys, who has a history of advocating for reproductive rights, said that if elected, she would prioritize repealing the ban and ensure no physician would face jail time or a conviction for providing abortions. Anti-abortion groups, however, see Roys' position as extreme, pointing to surveys that show divided opinions on abortion legality in Wisconsin. Despite this, Roys believes her stance will attract support from both Democrats and Republicans who favor access to abortion.",
        "snippet": "Since at least 1849, it has been illegal to perform an abortion in Wisconsin. That law, like similar laws in other states, was rendered unenforceable in 1973 by the U.S."

        "summary": "Democrats are pushing for a procedural vote in the Senate next week on legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into law, following a leaked Supreme Court draft indicating the likelihood of overturning the 1973 ruling. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized the importance of the vote, despite the expected failure due to the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. The vote aims to force Republicans and certain Democratic senators to take a public stance on abortion rights. Previous attempts to advance similar legislation were blocked, including by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Two Senate Republicans, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, proposed their own bill with exceptions, but Collins has indicated she will not support Schumer's bill. With the filibuster blocking progress, Democrats are facing calls to reform it, though they lack the votes for such a change. Republicans are not engaging with the substance of the draft opinion, instead focusing on the leak and calling for an investigation into its release.",

        "title": "Democrats need 60 votes to codify Roe - PressReader",
        "summary": "'Due to U.S. Senate rules, Democrats need 'more than a majority' to codify Roe vs. Wade', stated by Kelda Helen Roys. This is because the Senate requires 60 votes to end debate and proceed to a vote on a bill, a rule that can allow a minority to block legislation. Despite Democrats holding a majority in the Senate, they would need additional support to overcome Republican opposition, as all Republicans oppose codifying Roe v. Wade. The filibuster rule, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation, complicates efforts to pass such bills, and exceptions like budget reconciliation do not apply to abortion rights legislation.",

        "summary": "The U.S. Senate's amendment process allows Senators to propose changes to bills during consideration. Amendments are first reviewed by committees, followed by individual Senators offering amendments in any order. Debate on amendments is usually unlimited unless restricted by motion to table, unanimous consent, or cloture. There are various types of amendments, such as first-degree (changes the text of the bill), second-degree (changes the first-degree amendment), and perfecting amendments (minor changes). Major amendments that replace the entire bill or a first-degree amendment are known as substitute amendments. Senators can propose multiple amendments, with the order of recognition affecting the number of amendments offered before voting. Amendments are generally required to be germane under specific circumstances like general appropriations bills, cloture, or certain consent agreements. However, amendments can address any subject unless restricted by special rules, such as unauthorized appropriations in appropriations bills. Amendments can be withdrawn or modified until the Senate takes action on them. Senators may request that amendments be divided for separate votes. The process is further restricted under cloture, with amendments only being allowed if submitted before the cloture vote.",

        "summary": "A broad majority of Americans did not want Roe v. Wade overturned, according to polling before the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate the federal constitutional right to abortion. A May CNN poll found 66% opposed overturning the 1973 decision, with only 17% in favor. Most Democrats and nearly half of those under 35 expressed anger about the ruling. Additionally, 59% of Americans supported Congress passing a law to secure a nationwide right to abortion. Polls indicated that overturning Roe would particularly affect poor women and women of color, with many supporting more permissive state laws. The ruling could impact political motivation, with Democratic voters expressing higher importance of abortion rights in elections. The decision also led to decreased public approval of the Supreme Court, particularly among Democrats.",

He emphasized the need to overcome the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to advance a bill, to pass abortion legislation. Biden stated that an exception to the filibuster should be made for this issue, similar to past instances like voting rights. His support comes after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to pass their own abortion laws. However, some moderate Democrats oppose changing the filibuster rules, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized Biden's stance.",

        "summary": " 'Due to U.S. Senate rules, Democrats need more than a majority to codify Roe vs. Wade', stated by Kelda Helen Roys.The article discusses the implications of a leaked draft from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, suggesting that five ultraconservative justices may overturn Roe v. Wade, undermining 50 years of precedent and public opinion. This would likely lead to abortion being criminalized in several states, including Wisconsin, which has an 1849 law making abortion a felony with no exceptions. Furthermore, some GOP lawmakers are considering a nationwide abortion ban, while others in states like Louisiana are proposing extreme measures, such as charging women with first-degree homicide for having abortions. In addition to abortion, Republican lawmakers are exploring restrictions on contraception, such as IUDs and emergency contraception. These efforts have been part of a broader campaign against reproductive rights, despite strong public support for privacy rights. The article warns that with a Supreme Court willing to reverse Roe, other freedoms like birth control and LGBTQ rights could also be at risk. To protect these rights, the article calls for active voter engagement, particularly in Wisconsin, to support pro-choice Democratic candidates. Reelecting Governor Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul is seen as crucial for preserving abortion rights and preventing restrictive laws. On the federal level, electing a Democratic senator to replace Senator Ron Johnson could be key to securing the votes needed to codify Roe and protect abortion access nationwide. The article emphasizes that 72% of Wisconsinites oppose overturning Roe, and educating voters about the stakes of the upcoming elections is critical.",
        "snippet": "Marquette Law Schools January poll demonstrated that 72% of Wisconsinites oppose overturning Roe v. Wade. Now its up to all of us who care deeply about womens equality and freedom to spend this summer and fall educating that 72% of voters about what is at stake in the November elections."

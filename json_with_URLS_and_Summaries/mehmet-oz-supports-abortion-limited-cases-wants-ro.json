        "title": "Dr. Oz Struggles to Answer Abortion Question on Fox News - Newsweek",
        "summary": "Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate, struggled to clearly express his views on abortion during a Fox News interview. When asked about abortion laws, Oz stated he is 'pro-life' except in cases of rape, incest, and if the woman's health is at risk. He mentioned that he believes life begins in the mother's womb, but did not specify a legal limit for abortions. Oz emphasized the need for constitutional respect and stated that his pro-life views should not be undermined by the judiciary. In further comments to Newsweek, Oz clarified that he believes life begins at conception and reiterated his commitment to protecting life as a future Senator. Additionally, Oz discussed his conservative stance on issues like gun rights and criticized Big Tech, claiming that his campaign's account was restricted by Facebook.",

        "title": "Dr. Oz's Pro-Life Campaign Branding at Odds with Past Comments - Breitbart",
        "summary": "Dr. Mehmet Oz, running for the Republican nomination in Pennsylvania's Senate race, claims to be '100% pro-life' but has made past comments supporting abortion access. In a campaign ad, he spoke of the sanctity of life from conception but in a 2019 interview, criticized heartbeat bills, arguing that a six-week-old embryo doesn't have a 'beating heart' but rather 'electrical exchanges'. He has expressed discomfort with abortion personally but believes in not interfering with others' choices. Despite past pro-abortion statements, Oz's campaign is rebranding him as pro-life, writing in an op-ed that all life is a miracle from conception to natural death.",

        "title": "Inside Dr. Ozs Shameless Flip-Flop on Abortion - Yahoo! News",
        "summary": "Dr. Mehmet Oz, a television personality and political candidate, has shifted his stance on abortion rights dramatically over the years. In a 2019 interview, Oz expressed strong support for abortion rights, criticizing the anti-abortion movement for its potential harm to women's health. He described himself as personally opposed to abortion but advocated for keeping Roe v. Wade intact as it ensures viability limits on the procedure. Oz questioned the logic of defining life at conception and was concerned about restrictive abortion laws, like Alabama’s near-total ban, which he deemed misleading and unfair. However, in a recent interview, Oz showed alignment with the possibility of the Supreme Court overturning Roe, reflecting a change aligned with his GOP Senate candidacy. Despite this apparent shift, Oz previously voiced concern that overturning Roe would drive businesses out of restrictive states and lead to dangerous, illegal abortions. His commentary touches on broader topics, demonstrating his transition from a liberal stance to one that caters to conservative audiences in his political pursuits.",
        "snippet": "Oz conceded that abortion is a hard issue for everybody, and he said that, on a personal level, he disliked abortion and would not want anyone in his family to have one. But he took a common pro-choice position in 2019 that his belief should not be forced onto others. He would not want to interfere with everyone elses stuff ..."

In an interview, McCormick highlighted differences between himself and Oz ahead of their Senate primary debate. He emphasized his pro-life stance, contrasting it with Oz's less definitive views on abortion, including previous support for women’s access to abortion. McCormick supports the Second Amendment and criticizes Oz for advocating federal gun restrictions. Regarding energy, McCormick champions fracking, essential to Pennsylvania's economy, whereas Oz previously expressed concerns about its health impacts. On immigration, McCormick promotes border security and opposes Biden's policies, while pointing out Oz's previous support for DACA recipients and ties to hiring illegal migrants. McCormick views China as a strategic adversary, arguing for reduced dependency and criticizing Oz’s financial gains linked to Chinese products. Finally, McCormick supports recognizing the Armenian Genocide, questioning Oz's reluctance, linked to his dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship and military service in Turkey, raising concerns about national security and conflicting interests.",

About his 2019 interview on The Breakfast Club, Oz indicated support for the Roe v. Wade standard, opposing abortion bans based solely on heartbeat detection. He stated a personal preference against abortion within his family. During the debate, Oz affirmed his pro-life position, citing his heart surgeon experience and backing from his mother-in-law, a pro-life advocate.

Wade, without clear positions on exceptions for abortion.",

During an appearance on The Breakfast Club morning show, Oz said most people support the standard set by Roe v. Wade that bans abortion after the fetus is viable outside the womb, around 24 weeks of pregnancy."
